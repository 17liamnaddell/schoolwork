#My Elevator Speech

##SPEECH

1. __Imagine a world, where you go to a court room, or to the DMV or any other government property, without seeing a statue of Satan.__ It would be so frustrating and it would let pranksters put anything up on government property. 
1. We should not allow these statues for three reasons
  1. At the rate we are going at, any religiously aphiliated statue could be put on government property,

1. The government can veto a monument based off of the fact that it has no historical significance to the state
1. Court case: Pleasant Grove City v. Summum
