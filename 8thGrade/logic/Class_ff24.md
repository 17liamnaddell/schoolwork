#Formal Proof
1. Begins w/ a valid argument
2. to justify a F.P, we deduce the conclusion from the premises in a step by step way
  1. F⊃W
  2.~F⊃R
  3. Fv~F / ∴Wv(~F·R)
3. Rules of Inference(9-App.B)
4. 
#Rules of Replacement
1. Statements of equivalence
2. Some proofs cannot be justified or Proven
