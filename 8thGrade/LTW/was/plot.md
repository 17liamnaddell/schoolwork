#Outline

Opens on a person reading a news article
Then he shares it on a forum, and people start talking about how horrible the contents of the article are, and how sad the current political state is
After that, people start debunking it, using reason, different facts and so on.
People basically ignore it, then decide to keep on sharing it, and commentating on the contents. 
Because of this, a presidential candidate reads the article, then goes on news shows, talking about the article.
Then the proponents of the article start telling people debunking it about how the president agrees with them, and are confirmed.
that candidate wins by a landslide of 100,000 votes this was because of the opposite party not voting.
the person that originally shared the article sees that he spread something fake, and starts trying to quell the supporters of the article, but then are ridiculed.
Soon after, on the same forum, people are getting angry over the president's decisions, but not enough to get any sort of movement against him
many still believe the stories that they were told in the primaries.
People become poor, while some are angry, many still think that president is a great leader.
