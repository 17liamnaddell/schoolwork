##Why care
Development reasons, property tax base is around the lake
70% of water is ground water/ex ground water
#Water
##Water hardness
Hard water is less toxic
Water hardness is calculated by having minerals in it
##Water quality
Measured in ph
Must have DO in it
Must not be conductive
Cant have to much Bacteria, skin contact problems
Sediment, it causes lots of other issues

#Physical
Is a creek healthy?
Color? Is it a healthy color?
Temperature?
Warm water=bad
Quantity? How much water is there?
Discharge and flushing rate?
Is the water moving?
#Chemical
pH levels?
Conductivity?
Is there DO?
Nutrient availability?
  1. Phosphates?
  1. Nitrates?
Metals and other contaminants
The warmer the water is, the less oxygen is in the water
Water does not evenly mix
There can be pockets of water that have no oxygen, and others that have alot of oxygen
fish will die because they do not know where to go
Dead fish=bad
Do you see/smell anything?
Sheen=TERRIBLE
#BIOLOGICAL
1. Bacteria
  1. E. coli
1. Biological Oxygen Demand
1. Biodiversity
1. Categoris of water pollution
  1. Sewage
  1. Food processing industry
  1. Paper Mills
  1. Natural decaying vegetation
1. Thermal pollution
  1. Coal Fired Power Plants
  1. Nuclear fired power plants
  1. Gas fired power plants
1. Categories of Water pollution
  1. Sediments
  1. Plant Nutrients
    1. Runoff
    1. Sewage Discharge
  1. Tires
  1. PCB's pesticides/detergents/solvents/plastics
  1. Biological Pollution
    1. Hydrilla/parrotfeather/etc
    1. It was a problem
  1. Two sources of pollution
    1. Point Source: anything that enters a water body from a discrete point like a pipe
    1. Non Point Source: anything that enters a water body as a result of runoff of rainfall from land or atmosphereic deposition
    1. Biggest pollution sources in the Catawaba
      1. LAND DEVELOPMENT
      1. STOrm water
      1. Wastewater Treatment Plants
      1. Atmospheric decomposition

1. Sediment pollution Control act
1. Trys to keep sediment out of water
1. Storm Water Runoff Pollution
1. Comes through gutters/Storm drains

1. PCBs and Metals
  1. PCBs
    1. Used in most industrial applications until owtlawed in the late 1970's
    1. Do not breakdown
    1. Stick to sediments
    1. Linked with various cancers, skin lesions, irregular menstrual cycels as well as cognitive and immune deficencies
    1. Examples:
      1. Mercury
        1. 1/70th of a teaspoon of mercury can contaminate a 25 acre lake
        1. Lakes all around NC have mercury warnings
      1. Arsenic
1. River food chain
  1. River Food Web causes chemicals to go all the way up through the food chain

1. E-coli
  1. Very nasty
  1. SSOs are a huge source of ecoli.
  1. Sanitary Sewer Overflows
  1. There is a number on the SSO's call that

1. Clean Water Act
  1. The Clean Water Act establishes a goal of restoringand maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the water s of the united states by 1985


1. Power Plants
  1. 39 Mile span
  1. 75 Million Gallons per Day consumed (conservative)
  1. They consume 50% of water

#Whats wronk with stormwater?

1. Degrades water quality
1. Erodes, Floods, spills
1. Efficient Contaminant transport
1. Erosion is a huge problem
1. How to combat
  1. Rain gardens
  1. They are basically natural filtering system

#coal ash

1. Dan river has coal ash
1. They are water bodies that coal ash is put into, to contain them
1. They spill and leak unfortunately
1. orange water=bad water due to coal ash
1. You can sell it to concrete companies
1. Fix:Put it in concrete 

#CAFO
1. Not farming
1. 1100 poultry houses
1. Exempt from public record in NC
1. waste is land applied, can run off

#Sludge

1. Contains many untested contaminants
1. Antibiotic resistant bacteria
1. Waste is land applied, can run off.
1. Causes a high in phosphorous levels in SC

#Fish tissue sampling for PCBs

1. Do not break down and do accululate in fish tissue
1. caues cancer

#Silt fences

1. Construction causes erosion because there is no grass
1. It will in one year, do the damage of 10,000 if the silt fence is broken
