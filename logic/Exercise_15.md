Were the sons of god angels or were they righteous?
*Well, They could either have been good men or they could have been angels*
*If they were good men they would have pleased God*
*But they didn't make God happy, Therefore they must have been angels*

Why is that the case?

*Well, let me write out the formal proof for you*

*If we knew that they were either good men or angels, and we also know that all good men please god, as well as we know that they didn't
please god, we can conclude the following.*
*One, If they couldn't please god, then they must not be Good men, and since they were either good men or angels, we must know that they
were angels*
