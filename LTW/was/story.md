Hello, my name is REPORT:10 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ABUSING AMERICAN HEALTHCARE, and I am competition with JUST IN:OBAMA ILLEGALLY TRANSFERRED DOJ MONEY TO CLINTON CAMPAIGN!!! Last week JUST IN: OBAMA ILLEGALLY TRANSFERRED DOJ MONEY TO CLINTON CAMPAIGN!!! I got 1,000,000 views. This means that the article won 10,000 dollars. I need MORE money than that article, that is my business. I sell the commodity of manufactured outrage in return for ad revenue. 

Basically, I bully Illegal Immigrants because they deserve it, and steal our healthcare, tax dollars, and commit mass murder. 
It really does not matter how I read, the only thing that matters is my title. Nobody reads past the first few words these days. If that is what entertains you, then you are perfect for this. Assuming you truly want to know, just read a few passages:
_
I keep hearing about how our state is deteriorating – streets falling apart, air quality poor, and so on.
Recently I heard a report about the sad state of the streets in our state. They are in horrible condition due to potholes that will take hundreds of millions of dollars to repair.
This would be no problem in a working democracy, many pay taxes, etc. But our money is being drained away by the growing immigrant population coming from Mexico.
Now pay attention to the following.
All those billions of our tax money in the form of education (free!), health care (free!), law enforcement and social services (free!) went to the illegal aliens and their dependants.
The three million illegal immigrants and their 1.1 million U.S. born children cost the average American household $2,370 annually. And these amounts go back to 2010. Just think about it now!
While our state is falling apart and the state sinks billions of dollars into a worthless bullet train – which by the way is currently millions of dollars over budget – those mindless politicians and our ignorant Governor are wasting billions upon billions of dollars on illegal immigrants instead of
taking care of and fixing our state. Our money has been wasted by the politicians voted in by the Democrats.
You might think that the costs are bad for you, but think about people in sanctuary states like California. The costs come out to around $5,000 per person. That's why the cost for ANYTHING there is so high!

Why people enjoy me, I do not understand, but I am not in the business of understanding, I am in the business of telling people what they want to believe... For advertising dollars.

A man sees me, I grimace at his sullen appearance, I grimace at every appearance.
I can see his face turning red, the dead skin on his fingers skimming, and his eyes taking in only what his brain wants to see.

As he clicks the share button, I catch his fingers peck-typing an angry email to a cousin.

In only the space of an hour, I have spread by twofold. The man's cousin sees the title, eyes gleaming from the dream of validation in article form. He slowly reads over it, having the relief of ridicule over his ideas washed away temporarily. 

The cousin, Rob, remembers his blog, all of the happiness accompanied with how successful he was until he scrolled down. He saw nasty comments, dislikes, hate and most of all, general displeasure pointed at "that man who wrote this". His unsupported claims backfiring. But now, I have a very happy customer. 

So happy, in fact, he would recommend me to any man reading his blog. He covers it, gives gracious amounts of opinion, then posts his message. 

In only the space of a week, I have seen growth in sales, with my happy-to-be-unhappy customers. Taken up by anger as to not be disturbed by any of life's normal worries. They buy into a schizophrenic world view, one about how the government is out to get them, and how the invisible scapegoats are making their lives difficult.

A new woman sees me, her name is Katherine. She is disgusted by my content, obviously she does not know that you don't have to bring this product to a cashier to buy it; you buy when you click on the enticing title. I do not discriminate between viewers that believe me, and viewers that are disgusted by me. They still make me money. 

Katherine seems to have an air of power, a government position. The excitement I feel dreaming about being spoken of in government can only be represented in monetary value. Tomorrow feels like my golden day. So far I have 10,000 viewers, but that is not enough.

Tomorrow I am taken to the House floor, and I see the approving and disapproving faces of the people in the room, and I feel great. All of C-span is on me, the comedy TV shows talking about me, and all of the clicks, shares, reposts, and conversation about me spreading to many gracious or ungracious customers.

The customers I have has far surpassed JUST IN:OBAMA ILLEGALLY TRANSFERRED DOJ MONEY TO CLINTON CAMPAIGN!!! I have 10,000,000 views now. That is 100,000 dollars *all for me*.

I can see my most important customer on the horizon

He is watching cable news intently, phone out.

He sees me in the news, he angrily tweets out about me. Talking about his "new findings". 

Aside from the gain in views, I now have repeated customers. 

Many have seen the article, seen it on the news, and come back again for more.

A new tweet appears, "My team has found out about the influx of illegal immigrants flooding across the border, they come in the millions. Effective immediately, I will begin plans on making a wall to keep out the criminals coming across the border" 

This wall bill gets rejected by the House of Representatives, twice. On the third try it goes through, and starts getting funding. 

Taxes go up by $240 per household. While many are not put out of jobs, in the next 7 years, crime does not go down, people are not made safer, the drug problem never changes, everything is the same. Except for the $500 dollar wall bill. Every house must pay 500 extra dollars in taxes for the wall's maintenance. 

As the article, the only thing I care about is my net gain. I gained 199,500 dollars. I do not care about what I caused. Nor do I care about the global dysfunction I caused. The only thing I care about is selling copies. Copies of a world view.
