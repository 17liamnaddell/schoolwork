  <h2>
    REPORT:10 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ABUSING AMERICAN HEALTHCARE
  </h2>
  <p>
    I keep hearing about how our state is deteriorating – streets falling apart, air quality poor, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently I heard a report about the sad state of the streets in our state. they are in horrible condition due to potholes that will take hundreds of millions of dollars to repair..
  </p>

  <p>
    This would be no problem in a working democracy, many pay taxes, ect. But our money is being drained away by the growing immigrant population coming from Mexico
  </p>

  <p>
    Now pay attention to the following.
  </p>

  <p>
    All those billions of our tax money in the form of education (free!), health care (free!), law enforcement and social services (free!) went to the illegal aliens and their dependants.
  </p>

  <p>
    The three million illegal immigrants and their 1.1 million U.S. born children cost the average American household $2,370 annually.  And these amounts go back to 2010. Just think about it now!
  </p>

  <p>
    While our state is falling apart and the state sinks billions of dollars into a worthless bullet train – which by the way is currently millions of dollars over budget – those mindless politicians and our ignorant governor are wasting billions upon billions of dollars on illegal immigrants instead of taking care of and fixing our state. Our money has been wasted by the politicians voted in by the Democrats. 
  </p>

  <p>
    You might think that the costs are bad for you, but think about people in sanctuary states like California. The costs come out to around $5000 per person. Thats why the cost for ANYTHING there is so high
  </p>

  <p>
    Those billions of dollars should go into what needs fixing first (first-responders, school teachers, veterans, senior citizens, etc.) – then what’s left over they can dole out to others.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am sick and tired of all of the initiatives and special ballot issues. We do not need any more taxes to take care of anyone.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Let the state fork over some of the money they waste on illegal immigrants (billions) and start taking care of its own citizens.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am truly for Donald Trump’s wishes to deport all immigrants who are here illegally. I am tired of my tax money being wasted on them. That is not why I pay taxes.
  </p>

  <p>
    We should have a say on what and where our taxes go. They should not be used on illegal immigrants.
  </p>


  <p>
    But it gets worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    The democratic party can keep people in Washington because illegal immigrants vote for democratic politicians so that they can be rewarded with American healthcare according to a report
