1. Introduction 
  1. that scientist are unknowledgeable about the subject at hand.
  1. Evolution is not fact, ideology 
  1. Evolution is protected from critical thinking by the scientific
     community
1. Chapter 1
  1. The following written on a forum:
    1. Was a christian
    1. First chapter was a poem
    1. God is outside time and space
    1. God created the laws of physics
    1. Christians that don't know about evolutions hurt god's cause.
    1. The post creator thought that this issue was just a matter of
       time.
    1. St. Augustine, god is outside of time.
    1. It is sensible that people mis-believe the sensibility of the
       issue
    1. God-guided evolution is not what modern scientists mean
      1. They think that evolution is not god guided
      1. 1995 Position Statement Of the NABT: The diversity of life on
         earth is the outcome of evolution: an un-suporvised,
         impersonal, unprodictable, and natural proccess of decent
         with genetic modification, that is affected by, natural
         selection, chance, historical contenciancies, and changing
         enviorments. 
      1. Goerge Gayloard simpson: Man is the result of a purposeless,
         and natural proccess that did not have him in mind. 
      1. Naturalism: The doctrine, nature is all there is
      1. Darwanism is mindless, and godless
      1. People are just in denial. 
      1. Mistake no 2, god made the laws, then just retired
        1. Sience I have *PROVEN* above in mistake no 1, that all
           aethiests belive that evolution is unguided: in order for
           the following to be true, you have to believin in Diesim 
        1. Diesim: God is a remote first cause, who establishes
           scientific laws, then leaves nature to it's own devices. 
        1. Diesim != theism
        1. Evolution is a conversation, not a one sided, darwin is
           always right, and therefore can define evolution. 
        1. Author says evolution = evolutionary naturalism 
      1. Mistake 3: giving away the relm of reason
          1. People believe in many things
          1. Reason is a better appeal than faith
          1. Santa Claus example
          1. You can either have faith or reason, you can't have both. 
          1. Evolution=reason
          1. Creation=faith
          1. Just like santa, believing in reason over faith will make
             you look insane as you get older.
          1. This argument relies on mistake number 1 to be right
          1. *Having reason makes you a worse christian*
          1. *Basically: you cant have reason and faith* "You are
             trying to ride two horses that go the opposite directons"
          1. The blind watchmaker thesis: The darwinian claim that god
             is not nessisary for evolution, because the impersonal,
             material forces of genetic mutation, and natural
             selection, can and did produce all of the fantastic
             complexity of living organisms
          1. science is naturalistic and materialistic in philocophy
          1. They defined the terms such that they win the argument by
             forcing christians to use their termanology
          1. darwanism=tyranny
          1. Only one of ten americans accept NABT's definition.
          1. 90% attribute our existance to god, and among our ranks
             are half creationists.
          1. The opposition=troublemakers
          1. I agree with the commonfolk(author)
1. Chapter 2: inherit the wind
  1. Darwin=dogmatism
  1. Evolutionists are dismissive
  1. Inherit the wind came out in 1925, scopes trial
  1. Inherit the wind=stereotype of Christians
  1. Inherit the wind
    1. Burt Kates, science teacher
    1. Jailed against violating state law on teaching Darwinian theory
    1. Love with Rachel Brown 
    1. RB = teacher, and daughter of local minister Reverend Jerimiah Brown
    1. Vicious bigot that likes to damn people
    1. Rachel: Conformist
    1. Matthew Harrison Brady = prosecuting lawyer
    1. Becomes broadcasted by media
    1. journalist Ek hornback, a journalist, comes with sarcasm and
       cynicism
    1. Townspeople sing about old time religion.

    1. The bible and darwin can balance out. 
  1. What really happened
    1. DT wants to put itself on the map
    1. They create a "Law" against teaching evolution
    1. Gov. Assigns bill assuming law will not be inforced
    1. A. Civil Liberities union puts aethiest teacher on fake trial.
    1. Mock trial will be good for buisness
    1. JTS = pe teacher as "defendant"
    1. Never in danger of going to jail
    1. It became a media circus
    1. Brian Sees Darwinism abused to forward the leading people's
       schemes
    1. Dero hates religion, and wants to get rid of it. He denies that his clients have free will, and cannot be held to their actions
    1. Brian = Scientific Ignoramus
  1. What the play means:
    1. About modernist understanding of freedom
    1. Once apon a time, earth was ruled by abusive Chrisitans
    1. Then, the Darwinist heroes teach a philosophy, and free
       humanity. 
    1. Cinderella example
    1. Bitter attack against stern Christians
    1. Or people that see the bible as a reliable historical record. 
    1. People seeing the movie became the citizens of DT
1. Chapter three
  1. Evolutionists portray their science as fact, and any debate is
     unwinnable
  1. Debates are sometimes framed as such that evolution = fact and
     creationism = iediology.
  1. The author displays evolutionists as tyranists.
  1. Example: 'the tyranny of evolution', 'evolution=neutral fact and
     opposition=ridiculous'
1. Chapter four
  1. says that scientists think that all people that appose evolution are idiots
  1. genuine intelectual challenges to Darwinism 
  1. scientists do not understand the difference between common design and naturalistic evolution
  1.
###NOTABLE
The NABT defintion of evolution does NOT say that evolution excludes
religion. It says that you cannot teach religion of any kind as
science because religion is NOT science. 
They say that religion is not science, therefore it should not be
covered in a SCIENCE class
THE NABT IN NO WAY TAKES ANY POSITION ON RELIGION AT ALL

You will eat the best of the land;
