1. Introduction 
  1. that scientist are unknowledgeable about the subject at hand.
  1. Evolution is not fact, ideology 
  1. Evolution is protected from critical thinking by the scientific
     community
1. Chapter 1
  1. The following written on a forum:
    1. Was a christian
    1. First chapter was a poem
    1. God is outside time and space
    1. God created the laws of physics
    1. Christians that don't know about evolutions hurt god's cause.
  1. Refutation:
    1. The post creator thought that this issue was just a matter of
       time.
    1. St. Augustine, god is outside of time.
    1. It is sensible that people mis-believe the sensibility of the
       issue
    1. God-guided evolution is not what modern scientists mean
      1. They think that evolution is not god guided
      1. 1995 Position Statement Of the NABT: The diversity of life on
         earth is the outcome of evolution: an un-suporvised,
         impersonal, unprodictable, and natural proccess of decent
         with genetic modification, that is affected by, natural
         selection, chance, historical contenciancies, and changing
         enviorments. 
      1. Goerge Gayloard simpson: Man is the result of a purposeless,
         and natural proccess that did not have him in mind. 
      1. Naturalism: The doctrine, nature is all there is
      1. Darwanism is mindless, and godless
      1. People are just in denial. 
      1. Mistake no 2, god made the laws, then just retired
        1. Sience I have *PROVEN* above in mistake no 1, that all
           aethiests belive that evolution is unguided: in order for
           the following to be true, you have to believin in Diesim 
        1. Diesim: God is a remote first cause, who establishes
           scientific laws, then leaves nature to it's own devices. 
        1. Diesim != theism
        1. Evolution is a conversation, not a one sided, darwin is
           always right, and therefore can define evolution. 
        1. Author says evolution = evolutionary naturalism 
      1. Mistake 3: giving away the relm of reason
          1. People believe in many things
          1. Reason is a better appeal than faith
          1. Santa Claus example
          1. You can either have faith or reason, you can't have both. 
          1. Evolution=reason
          1. Creation=faith
          1. Just like santa, believing in reason over faith will make
             you look insane as you get older.
          1. This argument relies on mistake number 1 to be right
          1. *Having reason makes you a worse christian*
          1. *Basically: you cant have reason and faith* "You are
             trying to ride two horses that go the opposite directons"
          1. The blind watchmaker thesis: The darwinian claim that god
             is not nessisary for evolution, because the impersonal,
             material forces of genetic mutation, and natural
             selection, can and did produce all of the fantastic
             complexity of living organisms
          1. science is naturalistic and materialistic in philocophy
          1. They defined the terms such that they win the argument by
             forcing christians to use their termanology
          1. darwanism=tyranny
          1. Only one of ten americans accept NABT's definition.
          1. 90% attribute our existance to god, and among our ranks
             are half creationists.
          1. The opposition=troublemakers
          1. I agree with the commonfolk(author)

bible verses:
Isaiah 1:18-19
"Come now, and let us reason together," Says the LORD, "Though your
sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow; Though they are
red like crimson, They will be like wool. "If you consent and obey,
You will eat the best of the land;
