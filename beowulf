beowulf is a man
he is a legend
doesn't like weapons
there is a monster terrorising the danish
beowulf is semi-human
beowulf might be afraid, but dosen't show it
grenda is the monster?
aeschere is carried off by grenda
aeschire was close to the king, he was a nobleman
beowulf goes of to fite grenda
aeschire's head is left on the lake
strange cratures in the lake
strange submarine lair with fire in it 
grendals mother is in there
kills grendals mother with giant sword
beowulf lacks a defined sense of self
king of beowulf is hygelac
unferth verbally fites beowulf
beowulf as a kid was bad, lazy
hygalac is beowulfs mothers brother
hygalac isn't fictional
hygalac died in a raid on the netherlands in 255 ad
lived in the heroic age
if higalac dies, beowulf mite be king
everyone in the poem is vulnerable
wealthheow is the 2nd kings wife, and knows that everyone is vulnerable
in the last 3rd of the poem, he squares off agains the dragon, he is king, 
defeats the sweeds, but has no wife or child
king of yaeats
beowulf has to pysch himself up
beowulf sits down when he gets there
he knows fate is near.
beowulf has made mistakes
spirit unaffected by time > young strength
the dragonfire is almost to much for him
the dragon almost kills beowulf by biting him with poison fangs
wiglaf distracts the dragon, and beowulf kills it
beowulf was pagan
last speech is that death has sweapt away his whole family. 
wiglaf is the only left.
gain glory before your death.
