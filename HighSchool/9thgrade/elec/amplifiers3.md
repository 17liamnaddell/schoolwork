## The search for the ideal amplifier

* Many things besides audio are amplified every day bro
* Pressure sensors are one of these.
* We want high gain.
* Or a easily controlled gain
* Ideal gain=Infinate.
* Tempered with negative feedback
* Negative feedback will be explained in a further lesson
* We want low output resistance
* That way there is less current being wasted in the output terminal
* Ideal: Zero
* More power to ya! (lol)
* We want high input resistance to draw minimal current
* Ideal: Infinate
* Ideal amplfier would not look like it was connected to anything.
* We also want a flat frequency response
* We need it to amplify DC and AC which means we cannot use capacitors
* Capacitors block DC current unfortunately

## Difference amplifier

* Has an npn transistor
* mirror this circuit along the line of symmetry
* Gives zero output if there is no difference in circuits
* output voltage = v1-v2

## OpAmps

* Next few lessons are going to be about opamps
* these are like compact difference amplifier
* Features:
* 2 inputs
* 1 output
* High Gain
* Low output resistance
* High input resistance
* Broad frequency response
* Can handle DC

### Cool opamps

* 741 Op amp created in the 70's
* TL081 Op amp is the default for circuitlab
* Nas a Noninverting input, and a inverting one
* Has a positive power supply
* And a negative power supply
* And one output
* Vout=A(V+-V-)
