+ allowing one circut to control another
+ you can use transistors as amplifiers  
+ two types, FET's and BJT's, BJT used in amplifiers some times
+ two kinds of FETS
+ MOSFETS and JFETS
+ mosfets are p type semiconductors, and two small n type semiconductors 
+ P\N junctions are at the heart of modern electronics
+ they have a glass over the middle end 
+ thin coating of metal above the glass,
+ when you apply a positve charge, attracts negative charge. this is between the n type materials. This forms a bridge for electrons to cross
+ on to jfets
+ cylander of n type with a band of p type
+ regularly it runs fine
+ when you apply negative charge the depletion zone increases because it is reverse biased. you can turn this off this way
+ on to bypolar junction transistor
+ made of collector, base, and emitter
+ you can use bjt's to handle larger currents than the thingy can handle 
+ ex: transistor swtitch
