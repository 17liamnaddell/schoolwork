* We will build a 2cea
*   Cea stands for two (part) common emitter amplifier
* there are two amplifiers in a 2cea
* we use a capacitor to connect the circuits together because it does not let dc current thru 
  * Capacitors are good for this kind of thing because they sort out the base current or beta

* a 2cea is not inverting because it has two inverting outputs
  * basically it is a double negative
* a potentiometer is another type of resistor
  * potentiometer=variable voltage divider
  * Basically a potentiometer will act like a volume control circuit
  * they are nobs

Enter the TEF.
The problems with the other model described above is that the transistor still has to be biased, and this dissapates heat energy. Which is inneficient

* We will employ Complementary Symmetry.
* Now, there are two load voltage charts because one is for the negative, so when the current goes negative, there is still output
* This does not work tho because both transistos are off sometimes
* We just add a few diodes to make it more sensitive
