* feedback=A change in a system that is caused by an earlier change
* Negative feedback deminishes and stabilizes.
* Negative feedback is when a change happens that makes less change happen.
* Positive feedback enhances the oritional change, destabalizing
* Positive feedback is when a change causes more change to be enacted in a forever loop of change
* Ice-Albedo feedback.
* 1. Earths temperature increases, leads to less ice, more reflective bc of more water, therefore more solar energy and more heat.
* For a feedback system, we need a sensor, an activator that enacts the change you want, and reenacts the system
* In the lecture, there is a lot of messing with negative and positive feedback.
* The first example is a voltometer
* It mesures voltage by useing a 741 power opamp, and the magic of negative feedback to create a needle that points to one direction if voltage is increased, and another direction if the voltage is lessened. 
* The first system was a servomechanism
* That means a "Slave Mechanism". Another example of this would be a powerful tractor that has a giant arm controled by somebodies hand
* It uses a potentiometer as well as a power op amp and a dc motor to move the needle
* If we change the potentiometer(changes resistance if voltage changes) with a resistor and a photoresistor, we end up with a "intelegent lightbulb"
* The more light, the less the bright the circuit is.
* This circuit balences out natural light with artificial light to keep the lighting in a room stable
