# Points the bs makes

## "The fact that an ice sheet is melting is only evidence that The part of the world that holds the ice sheet is warming up"

* Do I even have to explain why this is trash?
* Ok then, 
* According to _the guardian_, hundreds of thousands of people have had to leave their homes because of rising sea levels caused by YOU GUESSED IT, MELTING POLAR ICE CAPS
* According to the noaa, this is caused by the temperature of the water being raised since 1950, and the polar ice caps melting.
* 40% of americans live near the coast, and the rate of flooding has increased by at minimum 300% and at maximum, 900%


## "the world's temperature has always been changing"

* The mistake the author makes here is confusing the weather with the climate. 
* and, the example he fabricates with antartica is false because antartica and the artic are different, antartica is a land mass, the artic is an ocean. 

_Antarctica and the Arctic are two very different environments: the former is a continent surrounded by ocean, the latter is ocean enclosed by land. As a result, sea ice behaves very differently in the two regions. While the Antarctic sea ice yearly wintertime maximum extent hit record highs from 2012 to 2014 before returning to average levels in 2015, both the Arctic wintertime maximum and its summer minimum extent have been in a sharp decline for the past decades. Studies show that globally, the decreases in Arctic sea ice far exceed the increases in Antarctic sea ice._

* According to the washington post, the cold does not even debunk climate change, "yet Turner(the man who broke the story of artic cooling) stresses this doesn’t mean climate change isn’t happening — only that natural variability in the region is quite large, and has recently kicked into gear for rather complex reasons. "

* "They just have a political adgenda to push", Says the science denier in his "statement of scientific fact".

* They ignore 70% of the data from the earth's surface

Firstly, who is "they" and secondly, you ignore 80% of the climate scientists out in the world

"Given these results, it is clear that support among scientists for human-caused climate change is below 97%. Most studies including specialties other than climatologists find support in the range of 80% to 90%."

## The final fallacious claim

"The climate change there is does not matter because it is only a few degrees"

a two degree(celsius) change would double the rate of extinction

3% are being wiped out now, and if the temperature changed two degrees celsius, 5% of animals would be wiped out.
