1. Mechanical energy
2. Potential energy
3. Joule
4. GPE
5. kinetic NRG
6. Rule of conservation of NrG
7. D
8. B, its turned into GPE
9. B, GPE=mgh
10. A
11. When speed or mass changes, KE=1/2MV^2 so D
12. C. The total amount of NRG in the universe never changes *conservation of energy*

  1. 0.245,0.3675,0.49
  2. 2.449225,3.667225,4.906225
15. 4 duh. Look at the chart 1600/400=4
16. ~2100 because 10mph is about 400, and the graph will become steeper, thus 1600+500.
17. 150 because its halfway inbetween halfway of 400 and zero
18. Energy is conserved by being converted to thermal energy by friction.
19. Because einstien proved that mass is the same thing as energy in expirements relating to light having gravity. Thanks Austin
20. Because of tire-on-road friction.
21. ?
