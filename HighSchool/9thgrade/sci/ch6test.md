18. Refrigerators do not bestow some magical notion of coolness apon the materials inside of it, what they really do is pump the heat from inside of the fridge into the kitchen where it is located. Thusly keeping the fridge door open will do very little(or even nothing if the starting temperature is room temperature) to the kitchen.
19. Thermal energy is defined as "the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of all the particles in an object". If there are more particles in an object, then there is more thermal energy.
20. It is explained in the book that thermal energy is kinetic energy of particles+potential energy of particles. If heat only increases kinetic energy, then thermal energy could increase due to potential energy increasing. So this statement is not always true. 
21. "Convection occurs in fluids. Rising of warmer fluid and sinking of cooler fluid forms a convection current", and "Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy by collisions between more energetic and less energetic particles, Conduction occurs in solids,liquids, and gases". Because the fluid is already at the top, convection will not take place, so conduction is our best bet
22. Heat evaporates coolant, then is put through expansion valve, turns into gas, when it becomes gas, it cools, then is pumped through pipes where it heats up, then is put in compressor until it is greater than room temperature,then the heat goes out through the condenser coils
