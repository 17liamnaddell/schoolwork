# Formal summary of the US Constitution

## Situation

The articles of confederation were restricting government power too much, so a few people were saying we needed to scrap it.  They claimed that the government needed the following new abilities;

* Raise taxes
* fund an army
* make it so that a lesser majority can pass laws
* join the states up a little more

just to name a few. 

They came under criticism for purposing a government that could enfringe on peoples rights a lot more if abused.

## The effect

After the government adopted this new constitution, the government was able to actually do things.
