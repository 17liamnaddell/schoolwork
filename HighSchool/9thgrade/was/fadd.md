# Formal summary of Washington's farewell address

## Situation:

The country was in disarray under the articles of confederation, debt was not getting paid, militaries were not funded, and people were upset. He was called to act as a president to hopefully solve these problems. 

## Effect:

After a fairly sucessful presidency, he had to leave office; even though many wanted him to be the king of the united states. It took awe-inspiring amounts of gratitude to let up the position as king to start the nation anew.
