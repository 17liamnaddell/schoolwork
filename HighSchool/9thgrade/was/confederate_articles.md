# Situation, strengths, and weaknesses of the articles of confederation

## Situation

The articles of confederation were created as we were rebelling against Great Britain, we wanted a power structure where a monarchy could never exist

## Strenghts

Almost impossible to pass any right-restricting law because of how clunky the government was

## Weaknesses

Could not raise taxes, could not raise an army to defend the nation, and could not actually protect its citizen's property from homeland thieves. It had a tyranny of the minority problem as well.
