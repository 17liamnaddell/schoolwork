# Situation

Dred Scott was living in a free state when he was sold to another slaveholder in a slave state. After this, he sued the court. This court case argued the question can a slave be sold to another slaveholder while said slave in a free state. The case even went as far to say that slaves should not even be able to sue in American courts. 

# Effects

Many abolitionists were furious about how degrading and dehumanizing the dread scott decision was to slaves. It went as far as to make slaves akin to property, which was a opinion that many slaveholders themselves did not have. This helped fan the flames of conflict that led to a real civil war.
