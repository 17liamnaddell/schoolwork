# Situation

This was the third year of the civil war, and a line needed to be drawn in the sand. Thankfully, Abe Lincoln drew this line. He said that all slaves in the US shall be free. 

# Effects

While this proclamation did not end slavery, it did open the gateway for other slavery ending mechanisms to be created. It did not end slavery because of the fact it only affected states that had not succeeded from the union. It opened a door for freedom.
