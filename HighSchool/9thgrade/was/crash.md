# What caused the crash?

The New York Times wrote an article about short-selling stocks while a slight depression in the stock market occured. After this article was written before the crash, a large company with thousands of investors was revealed to use fraudulent collateral to buy steel. Many stockholders lost money there too, causing more selling of stocks. The Dow dropped more. By now everybody was panicking and mass selling stocks. This caused the entire market to crash.

# What were the effects?

People were fiancially destroyed, and this crash wiped people out. People spent like the good times were never going to end, and they played their hand a little too hard in the 1920's. This contributed to the Great Depression that would happen shortly after. Soon after this, 650 banks fell increasing the value of money due to the fact that there was less credit going around. Buisnesses' revenues shrunk, and the Great Depression had begun. 

# Why did it not rebound?

Because faith was lost in the market, people thought the market was untrustworthy and unstable. Because of this, people spent less money. This caused businesses to fail because less money was spent, which in turn caused employees to lose jobs, contributing to less people buying stuff. Then the cycle tragically repeated itself.
