# Natural laws

Men have no control over them, they are not inforced by a person
Gravity and the energy of motion are natural laws

Gravity is the force that pulls things to the earth

Energy of motion is a kinetic energy
Happens when objects move, to move, you require kinetic energy
More speed=more kinetic energy
If you ride a bike at low speeds that is light, you can control it; but when you drive a car or truck that is cought in an emergency situation, the forces can work against you

## Total stopping distance

It is made up of 

### Perception time

What you see

### Reaction time

how long it takes your foot to touch the brake
How you react

### Braking time

The time between touching the brake and stopping the car

## Force of impact

When two objects hit each other 
It depends on the speed and the weight
Less weight-less impact
The heavier-more impact

## Three second rule

Give yourself 3 seconds to stop, and a 3 second following distance
At the DMV, they look for the two second rule. 
Be able to see the tires touching the pavement

## Blind spot

Area you do not see in your mirrors
You should be able to see behind you/ your whole back mirror
left mirror should be able to see everything on the left of the car, reverse with right mirror
When changing lane
to check blind spot, turn head

### No zones

The blind spots on 18 wheelers They cannot see you if u are right in front of them, or if you are 45 degrees behind the car in the other lane from the front of the car to the back of the first car(It is kind of like a wing)

If you can't see the mirrors, they cant see u
