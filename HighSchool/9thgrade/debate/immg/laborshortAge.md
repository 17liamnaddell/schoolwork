America is about to run short of workers for the simple reason that people are retiring. The oldest of the Baby Boomers are now 69 and leaving the workforce. Meanwhile, the retiree population is growing at the other end as people live longer.

Put the two trends together, and the result is a boom in senior citizens. In the next 10 years, the Census Bureau estimates, the population of people 65 and older will increase by 37.8%. The population of those 18 to 64 will rise by only 3.2%. (And those 18 to 24 will actually decrease in number.)
