|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| The call of the wild keeps calling to buck even though he has thorton | Thorton does love buck | buck is a dog |
| The transformation from ppl dog to wolf dog is made by hunger and abuse | Because of thorton's love, buck is made happy | he is kidbnapped |
| Buck develops respec after being beaten by the club | respect could be confused with fear | he is put on train |
| Buck is more respectable under fortitude and abuse | buck fights back against the club this is an event the reader is supposed to love | this is canada  |
| the author probably loves the idea that nature is violent | This is the doomfist of dog books | he is bought for 300$ |
| the author has thorton respect the dog, not hurt him | there is a pride in hard work | he is a sled doge |
| the author puts value in hard work, but he is mistaken by this because it is forced work | | buck theves |
| forced work != hard work | the dog likes the forced work so it's ok | some dogs go mad |
| the dog could have stockholm syndrome | that is rediculous | spits is killed by buck |
| some masters are seen as 'good' in their beating of doges |  they are seen in relative good | buck becomes master |
| nobody likes getting beaten | the dog was never shown love before, so assumed this was more normal | "dogs count for little against dollars" |
| why should the dog like being subjected to the law of tooth and club |  | they work rly hard in new conditions |
| brutality is to be respected in this book | | wamen r soft to doges |
| in humans abuse does nothing good, why should it be good for animals? |                   | the new ppl are mean to dogs because they think they are lazy |
| abuse does make the dog happy indirectly |                   | some dogs starve to death in new conditions |
|  if the general consensis around animals is to survive, then why would they respond well to getting beaten? they are like "k" then if im bad then i get beat, ok thats fair wp |                   |                 |
| some dogs go mad | | |
