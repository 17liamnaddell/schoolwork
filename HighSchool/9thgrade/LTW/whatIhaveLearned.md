# How I have grown over the year

## LTW

My writing over the years as become more uniform, and significantly better. I went away form showing people banned words like show, get, went ect. I have tried to work on my spelling and punctuation, but I still will make many mistakes in these areas even though I have been improving. Most importantly my mommy says that my writing has dramatically improved. In the future I envision slow and steady improvements to my writing, but I do not feel like I will get to a point where I can avoid most errors.  

## Student in general

Before this year, I was less indepentant and required more management. Over the year I have taken more initiative in scheduling my workflow. I write a significantly larger portion of my essays, and as a student I am much more capable of taking tests and memorizing information. At my old school, we did not practice traditional school skills like tests, papers, projects and memory work. Coming to CC, this was very new for me *cough cough* Henle. 

## Math

Some of my biggest strides were in mathematics. Currently I am enrolled in AOPS, which was really challenging to me. So far I am on my third semester of AOPS, with dramatic improvements to my ability to reason and solve problems logically, I am now able to solve most of the problems they throw my way. My goals as a student in maths is to into calculus as soon as possible, while maintaining my ability to keep up with the pace of the course.
