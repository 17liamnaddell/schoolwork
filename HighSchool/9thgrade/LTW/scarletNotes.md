| things I hate about this book: |   | they are in a garden  |
| The author never makes me care about hesterprine. She does not compel me to feel bad for her. |   | ppl walk by  |
| The action is forced. Hester does not freak out that ppl r coming to take her child until the very end of the conversation. |   | the governer and priest are there at the house  |
| The plot is character driven, but the characters are vailed behind a mask of linguistics.| | They are quite mean |
| There are plenty of scenes where nothing is happening. One scene, the child and mother are just talking to eachother. This conversation adds nothing to the story.| | they want her child taken away |
| Too much fluff just like holding ur hand over yur heart and bs | | they take a scene of her child almost being taken away and turn it prim and proper. This is clearly not realistic |
| the relationship feels forced and unbelievable. There is no reason for them to love each other| | They now want to take her away, then she gives a speach. They want to take her away because they think she is dumb |
| The author words the book as if it is always happening in slowmo. He uses so much to express so little.| | it does get intense, but not immediatly, and she gets to keep her child |
| The above ruins the pace. Tom sawyer happens in real time, and Scarlet letter happens in a reverse wormhole| | which trials are going on |
| This makes the atmosphere gloomy. This is a great tool, if used effectively, but it is overused to $#!! here. | | the man in the affar is alive |
| They get together, and talk about how much dimsdale's life sux. I don't care. | | dimsdale is old (the person who argued for hesterprine |
| She tries to hit on him again, WHY?!?!??!. She hit him up saying "hey lets share sins together" | | Admitting sin feels good according to the priest |
| rodger killingsworth is her husband. | | they thing she is less miserable because of the A |
| I have no idea why hester goes near him. | | dimsdale is depressed and has a physician assigned to him |
| WHY DOES SHE CARE FOR THIS GUY. | | author wants you to like dimsdale |
| THIS MAKES NO SENSE | | dimsdale feels bad lol |
| the plot and character motives make no sense. | | Which trials are happening |
| why does it matter that rodger is her husband. is it because rodger loves dimsdale's preaching? | | hester is a good person |
| Rodger has a "true nature" that is probably bad but we are not told. | | hester gains reputation because she is nice. |
| Rodger sux somehow | | it became a mark of pride, and she is nice |
| she asks dimsdale to run away lol? | | it became a cross |
| he does not run away. because of dishonor. | | she is not affectionate tho |
| she wants him to change his name, run away and leave this life. | | the scarlet letter did not do what it was ment to do |
| he does not because he is a baby(this makes no sense) | | othr ppl know the secret |
| they decide to run away | | she was married to rodger rodgersworth |
| They want to run away TOGETHER? | | they really like superstition |
| away from society, they become happy again. | | he says his new way of life is more wise |
| pal cannot cross the bridge for no reason at all | | Rodger chillingworth enters. |
| children hate change, and will not cross the bridge | | is inspired, throws his existing election sermon in the TRAASSH |
| she has no reason to run away | | everybody is taking the day off |
| the child does not like the pastor she hates him | | the child speeks like a grown woman. It makes no sense |
| they now live in the forest | | puritanism is savage and shallow |
| they hide in a cruise ship maybe | | rodger tries to go with them |
| he meets people, then defies his want to talk trash about christianity. | | there is no bond between hester and the clergymen while some threat approaches. |
| he admits i think, and brings hester and pal up to the stage | | they got on ship yaiy |
| | | the pastor is dieng XD |
| | | he brings hester up to the platform |
| | | he admits the crim |
| | | he wore a scarlet letter on his chest. It was branded on his chest |
| | | "In the view of infinate purity, we are sinners all alike" |
| "be true be true be true, show teh world ur werst" | | hester was a hero because she owned up to her sin. |
