A                                                      N                                                               I
                                                                                                                        
-  The press was against him, and public opinion had al -   There would have been riots if the trial was even delayed   -   Two faced, asked chuck to shoot at Arthur Burns in the papers but next day was “most responsible and statemenlike” with is “very good friend Arthur burns”
ready been against him                                                                                                  
-  It would  be impossible to find an unbiases jury     -                                                               -   “Hubris became the mark of the Nixon man because hubris was the quality Nixon admired most”
                                                                                                                        
-  The general public would be less angry about the potential verdict                                                   -   “we had set in motion forces that would sooner or later make Watergate, or something like it, inevitable
                                                                                                                        
- The judge wouldn't be pressured to make a decision.                                                                   -   “if there is a loving god, the automatic next question was, of course, ‘If he is good, why does he preside over such and evil world’”
                                                                                                                        
- Everyone has a right to a fair trial                                                                                  -   “no priest or minister these forty yeaers has ever explained to me any of this”
                                                                                                                        
- The judge would have pre-case biases                                                                                  -   Bud Krough was the first Nixon man indicted after the waterggate entry
                                                                                                                        
- The jury would have been totally biased against chuck                                                                 -   Lie under oath for “national security reasons”
                                                                                                                        
- Riots could have ensued                                                                                               -   The CIA role in the Watergate it disclosed that howoard hunt was working for Robert R. Mullen and Company, ostensibly just another
                                                                                                                        
- Chuck coleson is not a dangerous person                                                                               -   Passed lie detector tests multiple times
                                                                                                                        
- He would not flee                                                                                                     -   “if your indicted Chuck, we’re together. That’s the way it is”
                                                                                                                        
- He was basically already in houese arrest                                                                             -   Nixon was manipulative, and a liar
                                                                                                                        
- With high profile cases like this one, it is hard to justfully rush through it                                        -   “Richard Nixon will use anybody. When he dosen’t need you, he’ll discard you”
                                                                                                                        
- You want him to be convicted beyond a reasonable doubt, not anything should get in the way of that                    -
