CHAPTER 9 PARAGRAPH
===================
Many american goods are created in other countries, and many US firms have a tough time producing in a importing country such as our own. One of these industries is the textile industry. We can use the textile industry as an example to answer three questions: What happens to the price of goods if you allow importing and exporting of goods, Who wins and who loses in the textile market, and do the gains outweigh the losses, and Should we tariff inmports? Assuming that our hypothetical country named isoland is small, and allows importing/exporting for the first time, will isoland become an importer or an exporter. This depends on the world price. If the price for a good in isoland is above the world price, then isoland will import. If the price for a good in isoland is lower than the world price, isoland will become an exporter. If isoland becomes an exporter, then their domestic consumers are worse off because the price of goods will rise to somewhere near the world price, on the otherhand, if isoland becomes an importer, then the domestic consumers are better off because the world price is lower. When measuring changes in economic welfare when we allow imports and exports, we often see that the winnings of the winners outweigh the losses of the losers. Tarrifs are taxes on imports, so if isoland becomes a textile exporter, then nothing will happen no matter how high the import prices are. When you add a tarrif to an importing country, the price of the good when imported rises by the amount of the tarrif, but also the domestic price rises as well because the domestic sellers have to compete less. While prices are one benefit to having free trade, others are there are more goods to buy, lower costs through economics of scale, more cometition, and better technology.
