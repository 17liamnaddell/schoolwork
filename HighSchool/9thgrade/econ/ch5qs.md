  1. "The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded respond to a change in price.
  2. "The income elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded changes as the consumer income changes."

  1. Availability of close substitutes
    1. If there are close substitutes near by, like in a grocery store, the elasticity will be greater.
  2. Necessities vs Luxuries
    1. Necessities are more inelastic, Luxuries are more elastic.
  3. Definition of the Market
    1. The broader the definition of the market, the more inelastic
      1. This can be seen in the fact that there is no good substitute for food
  4. Time Horizon
    1. If the time horizon is small, the elasticity will be smaller. People don't change off a good immedietly for instance. 
3.
  0. >=1=elastic
  1. 0=perfectly inelastic
4. No
5. Revenue will deminish because elasticity is high, and ppl will switch to other goods
6. An infierior good probably, although the book never mentions such a number
7. Percentage change in quantity supplied/Percentage change in price. It measures how much the quantity supplied responds to to changes in the price.
8. Pretty much zero because no matter how much you pay for it, none more can be made
9. 
  1. if the demand is elastic, the price will go up, and people will buy less fava beans.
  2. If the demand is inelastic, the price will stay pretty much the same, and people will only buy slightly less of it, making a profit for farmers.

# Quick check

1. Small elasticity of demand because people can't negotiate price. For example, insulin. 
2. 1/2
3. d
4. a
5. d, If the supply curve is elastic, small changes in price will result in large changes in supply
