a)
For the first problem, we can turn $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$ into $(x(x-2)-1(x-2))(x-3)$ by distributing the $(x-2)$ into the $(x-1)$. After that we can distribute the x in $(x(x-2)-1(x-2))(x-3)$ to get $(x^2-2x-1(x-2))(x-3)$. After this, we distribute the -1 to get $(x^2-2x-x+2)(x-3)$; we need to distribute the $(x-3)$ to get $(x^2(x-3)-2x(x-3)-x(x-3)+2(x-3))$. After distributing all of those new terms, we finally get $x^3-3x^2-2x^2+6x-x^2+3x+2x-6$. By combining like terms, we finish with $x^3-6x^2+11x-6$. The expansion of part a of this problem was $x^3-6x^2+11x-6$.

b)
This is definitely harder than part a. To do this, lets expand a sample equation to hopefully gain some insight as to how to factor these equations, this equation is going to be $(x+r)(x+s)(x+t)$. After expanding and simplifying this equation much like we did in part a, we get $x^3+tx^2+sx^2+tsx+rx^2+txr+srx+srt$. This looks really unhelpful, but it contains the solution to the equation. There are three parts of a "cubic" equation, I will call them the "Cube term"($x^3$ in this problem), "Square Term"($x^2$ in this equation), "Singular Term"($-11x$) in this equation) and "Constant Term"(-12 in this equation). We now know that the cubic term is the three first parts of the equations in parentheses. In this problem, they were x,x, and x. The square term is shown to be made out of adding t,s and r. We know this because they are the coefficients of every term raised to the second power. The singular term can be deduced in the same matter. Every term with only one x in it
