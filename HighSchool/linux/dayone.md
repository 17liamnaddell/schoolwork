# Code Combat

Boot the computers up and navigate in a web browser to `codecombat.com/play/dungeon`
As the kids come in, sit the kids down, and help them with codecombat if they need it.

# Explain Antergos

Once most of the kids show up, explain why Antergos is the OS of choice and give the kids a layout to help them understand Antergos

# Change the map

Change the map to "spleef"(located at ~/worlds/spleef on the server)

# Tell the kids to get onto the server

located in `Multiplayer>Amplified Learning Server` on the minecraft menu
Also make sure to tell them that you are the only one that is allowed to click "start game"
Change the mode every 3 rounds. Once you have played every round, move onto next thing by kicking the kids off the server(with `/stop` or `stop` from the command line)

# Put basic minecraft commands on the TV screen in the room

you know what those are.


# Redstone project

# Programming lesson

Have all the kids login to the server
Teach the kids how to use vim. Put the keybindings on the screen(you know what those are).
