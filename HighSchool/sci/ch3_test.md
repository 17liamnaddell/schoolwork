1. C
2. C - I can't predict exactly what will happen, but it might not have hit terminal velocity yet
3. A - The change is the greatest
4. D - The object's mass/anything does not change rite?
5. A
6. A, I don't know how much the object's mass changes though
7. B
8. 90N
9. 5mps^2 - a=fnet/m
10. doubles
11. Niether
12. Its lesser because you are further away from the earth
13. It really depends on the push, in that if you stop it mostly, then push in another direction, it will have less inertia. But if you only redirect it, depending on the ball it might not go in the same direction as your push.
14. No, because the second ball will have a greater terminal velocity due to the fact that it is more effective at dissapating weight than ball 1.
15. idk
16. Because each action has an equal and opposite reaction.
17 Because the baseball exerts a force on your hand, and the glove absorbs that force.
