Title: Atmospheric Pressure
Purpose: Demonstrate the fact that the atmosphere actually does exerrt pressure on everything it touches
Procedure:
1. Put some water in an aluminium can
2. Put em in a frying pan head up
3. Boil water
4. Fill a bowl with ice water
5. Put sum ice kubes in it
Noticings:
The cans that were placed face up did absolutely nothing besides create a little steam.
I failed to place two cans in properly, one can failed to crush.
The crushing was dramatic and instentainious.
It was very cool, and I would love to do it at home, and probably will.
