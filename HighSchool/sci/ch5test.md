  1. Simple machines do *work*
  2. Simple Machines combine to make compound machines
  3. Simple machine's mechanical advantage compares output force to input force
19. B ~1.26
20. There is no formula for this, there is the work formula, but then what is distance? Assuming the distance is the length of the Output arm, the answer would be 21 using the Work formula
21. The fulcrum should be near the adult, the effort force could be weighted twards the child, the resistance could be adjusted so that the adults side has more of it.
22. Use two pulleys next to each other, they both half the weight
23. A short fat handle because the mechanical advantage of a screwdriver is calculated by dividing the Radius of the wheel(In this case the handle) by the radius of the axle(in this case the shaft). Less shaft and more handle = more IMA
