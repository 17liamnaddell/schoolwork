  1. Now lets try it for another real place. Mars is at a distance of 1.5 AUs from the Sun. 1/d^2 = 1/1.5^2 = 1/2.25 = 44%. There is less than half as much sunlight falling on the surface of Mars as on Earth! Jupiter is at 5.2 AUs so 1/d^2 = 1/5.2^2 = 1/27 = 3.7%. Neptune is at 30 AUs so 1/d^2 = 1/30^2 = 1/900 ‰ 0.1%! Noon on Neptune is like very deep twilight on Earth!

  1. Mars's atmosphere is about 100 times thinner than Earth's. Without a "thermal blanket," Mars can't retain any heat energy. On average, the temperature on Mars is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius). In winter, near the poles temperatures can get down to minus 195 degrees F (minus 125 degrees C). A summer day on Mars may get up to 70 degrees F (20 degrees C) near the equator, but at night the temperature can plummet to about minus 100 degrees F (minus 73 C).

  1. The solutions contained ~10 mM of dissolved salts with 0.4 to 0.6% perchlorate (ClO4) by mass leached from each sample.

  1. So what does that mean? Right now NASA pays the Russian space agency Roscosmos about $81 million and change for a round-trip ticket in a Soyuz capsule. The latest five seats NASA bought in bulk were a little cheaper, about $74.7 million per seat. Another spokesperson for NASA, Kathryn Hambleton, told The Verge in an email that the ticket price includes:

  1. In “The Martian,” Mark Watney uses the Martian soil to grow potatoes in the controlled environment of the “Hab.” In reality, the soil on Mars actually does have the nutrients plants would need to survive on Mars! There may not be the right amount of nutrients depending on where astronauts land on the Red Planet, so fertilizers may need to be added to the soil. The perchlorates in the soil would be leached out and separated from the water.

  1. By far the greatest impact on the American landscape comes not from urbanization but rather from agriculture. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, farming and ranching are responsible for 68 percent of all species endangerment in the United States.

  1. Pesticides often don't just kill the target pest. Beneficial insects in and around the fields can be poisoned or killed, as can other animals eating poisoned insects. Pestcides can also kill soil microorganisms.

  1. ”  Um,…No. We’re not. We are growing, but definitely not at an exponential rate. In fact, our rates of growth are declining. Between 1950 and 2000, the world population grew at a rate of 1.76%. Between 2000 and 2050, it is expected to grow by 0.77 percent.[3] So yes, because 0.77 is greater than zero, it is a positive growth rate, and the world population will continue to grow.

  1.  Its soil contains water to extract
    It isn’t too cold or too hot
    There is enough sunlight to use solar panels
    Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by many to be sufficient for the human body to adapt to
    It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that offers protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation
    The day/night rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth: a Mars day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds

  1. Since the flowers were orbiting some 220 miles (350 kilometers) above the Earth at the time, the NASA-funded experiment suggests that plants still retain an earthy instinct when they don't have gravity as a guide.

  1. In an experiment testing how well we can grow crops in space, scientists have managed to harvest 10 crops, including tomatoes, peas, and rye, from soil that mimics the conditions on Mars
19. Mars: Our future on the red planet
  1. Mars' atmosphere is enough to overheat a ship when entering it, but not enough to break its fall, so decent would be very very tricky && 23
  2. "Made-on-Mars products can be useful for life support, growing crops, even radiation protection" && 28
  3. Several sources of water deposits on Mars have been recognized over the years, two of which appear reasonable sources of the essential water amounts. && 30
  4. A costly one-time trip heaving all required supplies from Earth makes exploration of the Red Planet unsustainable && 30

  1. 2/3 of all attempts to get rockets to mars have failed && 21
  2. Nasa says they will launch rockets in 2030 && 25
  3. "Can we get to mars? The answer is yes." && 25
  4. The new question: Can we live on mars? The answer to that is yes, too, but as Elon Musk might say, it's tricky. && 25
