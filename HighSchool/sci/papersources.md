  1. Now lets try it for another real place. Mars is at a distance of 1.5 AUs from the Sun. 1/d^2 = 1/1.5^2 = 1/2.25 = 44%. There is less than half as much sunlight falling on the surface of Mars as on Earth! Jupiter is at 5.2 AUs so 1/d^2 = 1/5.2^2 = 1/27 = 3.7%. Neptune is at 30 AUs so 1/d^2 = 1/30^2 = 1/900 ‰ 0.1%! Noon on Neptune is like very deep twilight on Earth!

  1. Mars's atmosphere is about 100 times thinner than Earth's. Without a "thermal blanket," Mars can't retain any heat energy. On average, the temperature on Mars is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius). In winter, near the poles temperatures can get down to minus 195 degrees F (minus 125 degrees C). A summer day on Mars may get up to 70 degrees F (20 degrees C) near the equator, but at night the temperature can plummet to about minus 100 degrees F (minus 73 C).

  1. So what does that mean? Right now NASA pays the Russian space agency Roscosmos about $81 million and change for a round-trip ticket in a Soyuz capsule. The latest five seats NASA bought in bulk were a little cheaper, about $74.7 million per seat. Another spokesperson for NASA, Kathryn Hambleton, told The Verge in an email that the ticket price includes:

  1. In “The Martian,” Mark Watney uses the Martian soil to grow potatoes in the controlled environment of the “Hab.” In reality, the soil on Mars actually does have the nutrients plants would need to survive on Mars! There may not be the right amount of nutrients depending on where astronauts land on the Red Planet, so fertilizers may need to be added to the soil. The perchlorates in the soil would be leached out and separated from the water.

  1. By far the greatest impact on the American landscape comes not from urbanization but rather from agriculture. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, farming and ranching are responsible for 68 percent of all species endangerment in the United States.

  1. Pesticides often don't just kill the target pest. Beneficial insects in and around the fields can be poisoned or killed, as can other animals eating poisoned insects. Pestcides can also kill soil microorganisms.

  1. ”  Um,…No. We’re not. We are growing, but definitely not at an exponential rate. In fact, our rates of growth are declining. Between 1950 and 2000, the world population grew at a rate of 1.76%. Between 2000 and 2050, it is expected to grow by 0.77 percent.[3] So yes, because 0.77 is greater than zero, it is a positive growth rate, and the world population will continue to grow.

  1.  Its soil contains water to extract
    It isn’t too cold or too hot
    There is enough sunlight to use solar panels
    Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by many to be sufficient for the human body to adapt to
    It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that offers protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation
    The day/night rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth: a Mars day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds

  1. Since the flowers were orbiting some 220 miles (350 kilometers) above the Earth at the time, the NASA-funded experiment suggests that plants still retain an earthy instinct when they don't have gravity as a guide.

19. Mars: Our future on the red planet

  2. "Made-on-Mars products can be useful for life support, growing crops, even radiation protection" && 28
  3. Several sources of water deposits on Mars have been recognized over the years, two of which appear reasonable sources of the essential water amounts. && 30

  1. It is also shown that while Mars may lack any cash material directly exportable to Earth, Mars' orbital elements and other physical parameters gives a unique positional advantage that will allow it to act as a keystone supporting extractive activities in the asteroid belt and elsewhere in the solar system.
  2. Under conditions of such large scale immigration, sale of real-estate will add a significant source of income to the planet's economy.
  3. In contrast to the Moon, Mars is rich in carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen, all in biologically readily accessible forms such as CO2 gas, nitrogen gas, and water ice and permafrost. 
  4. the energetics of plant growth make it inconceivable to raise crops on any kind of meaningful scale with artificially generated light.
  5. Mars, on the other hand, has an atmosphere of sufficient density to protect crops grown on the surface against solar flares. On Mars, even during the base building phase, large inflatable greenhouses made of transparent plastic protected by thin hard-plastic ultra-violet and abrasion resistant geodesic domes could be readily deployed, rapidly creating large domains for crop growt
  6.  On Mars, in contrast, the strong greenhouse effect created by such domes would be precisely what is necessary to produce a temperate climate inside.
  7. If made of high strength plastics such as Kevlar, such a dome could have a safety factor of 4 against burst and weigh only about 4 tonnes, with another 4 tonnes required for its unpressurized Plexiglas shield. In the early years of settlement, such domes could be imported pre-fabricated from Earth. Later on they could be manufactured on Mars, along with larger domes
  8. Mars will not have the division of labor required to make it fully self-sufficient until its population numbers in the millions.
  9. However, with a cost per launch of about $1 billion, the cost per immigrant would be $40 million. Such a price might be affordable to governments (for a time), but not to individuals or private groups. If Mars is ever to benefit from the dynamic energy of large numbers of immigrants motivated by personal choice to seek to make their mark in a new world, the transportation fee will have to drop a lot lower than this. Let us therefore examine an alternative model to see how low it is likely to dr
  10. There is an immense amount of it - 143 million square kilometer<Paste>
  11.  By habitable real-estate I mean that which is under a dome, allowing human settlers to live there in a relatively conventional shirt-sleeve open-air environment.
  12. Open real-estate is that which is outside the domes. It is obvious that habitable real-estate is far more valuable than open real-estate. Nevertheless, both of these can be bought and sold, and as transportation costs drop, both forms of Martian real-estate will rise in value. 
  13. Not so. Enormous tracts of land were bought and sold in Kentucky for very large sums of money a hundred years before settlers arrived
  14. In fact, if a mechanism were put in place that could enforce private property rights on Mars, land on Mars could probably be bought and sold now. Such a mechanism would not need to employ enforcers (e.g. space police) on the surface of Mars; the patent or property registry of a sufficiently powerful nation, such as the United States, would be entirely adequate.
  15. Sold at an average value of $10 per acre, Mars would be worth $358 billion. If Mars should be terraformed, these open land prices could be expected to grow 100-fold, with a rough planetary land value of $36 trillion implied.
  16. Far more valuable than the open real-estate will be habitable real estate beneath the domes. Each 100 meter diameter dome, massing about 50 tonnes (32 tonnes for the inflatable Kevlar pressure dome, 16 tonnes for the Plexiglas geodesic rigid shield dome, 2 tonnes for miscellaneous fittings), would enclose an area of about 2 acres. Assuming that dwelling units for 20 families are erected within it, and each family is willing to pay $50,000 for their habitation land (a plot 20 meters on a side), then the total real-estate value enclosed by a single dome would be $1,000,000.
