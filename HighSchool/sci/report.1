Profile of Mars 

.PP 
Mars is a desolate island in the same degree of cold as loneliness. It gets its frigid temperature from being 50% further away from the Sun than Earth (www.NASA.org).

At a frigid minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit  (Sharp), the red planet, which has a mass of 6.42*10^23 (Space.com) is rendered uninhabitable to anyone not  wearing a protective suit. Despite this cold temperature, it is still believed that there is running water on the surface of the planet (David,30); this is unlike any other planet except Earth, the travelers now can have water for drinking and irrigating. Another similarity Mars has with Earth is its clock cycle. Mars is only 39 minutes off of Earth's 24-hour clock(Mars-One). 

.PP
Alongside this is the fact that Mars has an atmosphere composed of mostly Co2, argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor(NASA) that can block solar radiation (Mars-One). This is true even though Mars' atmosphere is 100 times less dense than Earth's (Sharp). Mars was not always this way. 3.5 billion years ago, it used to be much denser.  What makes Mars so attractive to live on, even to figures like Elon Musk, is that it has carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen with an added bonus that these elements are in biologically accessable forms such as C02 gas,nitrogen gas, water ice, and permafrost.

As it is shown here: 

.PSPIC arableland.ps

.PP
Ariable land is defined as, 

.I "land that can be or is cultivated" 

(dictionary.com).  The amount of arable land in the United States has fallen significantly. If we had another planet to farm on, it would be beneficial to society and could be potentially profitable with government subsidy. Enviornmental advocacy groups like western watersheds believe that: 

.PP
.I "By far the greatest impact on the American landscape comes not from urbanization but rather from agriculture. According to the U.S department of Agriculture, farming and ranching are responsible for 68% of all species endangerment in the United States" (Wuerthner). 

Alongside this is the idea that this might be necessary for the survival of our species 

.I "As just about everyone already knows, this planet is currently experiencing some pretty unprecedented challenges. So much so that Stephen Hawking claimed this week that we only have 100 years to get humans set up elsewhere in the galaxy or our entire species will face extinction. His statement is rather dubious, but it's true that our future looks pretty bleak". (Popsci, FIX SOURCE) 

.NH 3
Land

.PP
Another source of revenue could be real-estate, 

.I "Under conditions of such large scale immigration, sale of real-estate will add a significant source of income to the planet's economy (Zubrin)".

Just how valuable is this? Mars' land, if sold at a conservative estimate of 10 dollars per acre, could translate to a 358 BILLION dollar industry. If Mars was made more habitable for humans, it could be worth up to $36 trillion as land prices would increase by a hundred fold (Zubrin). If you do not believe that Mars real estate could be valuable, look at the case of pre-settled Kentucky in the 18th century: 

.I "Enormous tracts of land were bought and sold in Kentucky for very large sums of money a hundred years before settlers arrived" (Zubrin). 

This shows that even if Mars' land is not presently accessable, it could still be valuable. There could potentially be a huge market for Martian real estate as people bet on the idea that their real estate would be worth more in the future when travel to and from Mars becomes more convenient. 

.NH 3
Mining

While we do not know the exact contents of the martian land, we do have ideas of what it may contain. "Mars has a different crust than Earth, and very different atmosphere" and so its minerals are going to be no less different". This shows that mars could potentially be incredibly valuable to miners because of potential rare ores and minerals, and valuable to scientists because of the possibility of rare elements or compounds not yet discovered on earth.

Combat pollution on Earth

.PP
As we heard from the quote in the section on Financial Incentives, agriculture has a big effect on the well-being of the country. One of the ways agriculture hurts the land is through pesticides, "Pesticides often don't just kill the target pest. Beneficial insects in and around the fields can be poisoned or killed, as can other animals eating poisoned insects. Pesticides can also kill soil microorganisms" (wwf.panda.org, FIX SOURCE). Paradoxically, another harm could be fertilizer "When the excess nutrients from all the fertilizer we use runs off into our waterways, they cause algae blooms sometimes big enough to make waterways impassable. When the algae die, they sink to the bottom and decompose in a process that removes oxygen from the water. Fish and other aquatic species can’t survive in these so-called “dead zones” and so they die or move on to greener underwater pastures. A related issue is the poisoning of aquatic life. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  (CDC), Americans alone churn through 75 million pounds of pesticides each year to keep the bugs off their peapods and petunias. When those chemicals get into waterways, fish ingest them and become diseased. Humans who eat diseased fish can themselves become ill, completing the circle wrought by pollution."

Plan B for the Human Race

"It's important to get a self-sustaining base on mars because it's far enough away from earth that [in the event of a war] it's more likely to survive than a moon base" - Elon Musk. Unfortunatly, we do live in a reality where it is possible for the earth, or large parts of it to be distroyed at any minute. Considering our president makes threats of nuclear war on twitter, we can never really be sure  weather or not we are on the brink of distruction or not. A colony on mars would be a great security for humanity, and if a disaster, be it nuclear war, global warming, solar radiation, asteroids, or disease struck the earth, we would be prepared to rebuild and replenish it.
