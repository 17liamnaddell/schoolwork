Crushing cans

My favourite expirement was the experiment about crushing cans. 

(Definition) In this expirement, we filled cans with steam, then put them face-down in cold water, and observed the results. (relationship)Unlike other exirements, most of the people were focuesed on the expirement, and were shocked to see the results. While there were other expirements, this was the most bombastic and exciting, and thus the best. The most boring expirement was about glass with crayon smeared onto it, and with water on top. (cirumstances) The reason this expirement happens is because the steam condenses, and creates a vaccum that succs up the can and cruncches it. The can compacting was instant and dramatic.
