	Taxation is increadibly important to the government as well as to the people of america. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr once said, "Taxes are what we pay for civilized society". When making economic policy, it is good to remember that taxes allways affect both sides of a monetary transaction based on elasticity no matter which side you tax. If the buyers will quickly go away from a good if the price increases, then the sellers pay most of the tax, but if the buyers have no choice but to buy the product(like in the case of insulin), then the buyers will usually pay the price of the tax. Another thing to remember is that people do not want to buy more expensive goods, so if the price of apples goes to 5 dollars, then people will not want to buy as many of them. This is called deadweight loss. Deadweight loss is when taxes disensentivise people to buy goods, resulting in overall less economic activity. The deadweight loss of taxes allways grows faster than the amount of revenue gained. Another idea realated to this one is the laffer curve. This idea is that some times taxes can be so large, and deadweight loss so big, that people stop buying stuff, and the taxes never come into play. I.e so much taxes, that the government stops making as much money through taxes. The laffer curve is a parabola with a negative slope.
