## Final Essay

QUESTION:Why does nobody understand inflations and recessions.

Many reasons actually. The first one is how you define inflation and deflation. Many many people disagree with you about what inflation and deflation actually means. Even worse is the discrepancy between what you think causes inflation, and what actually does. The very nature of this question is biased towards your position simply in the way you define terms. The first problem is that you build in an "increase in the money supply" into the definition of inflation. This is a biased definition. You have made the mistake of replacing cause(or what you believe to be the cause) with effect. Inflations _effect_ is not "an increase in the money supply" it is a devaluation of currency. Deflation is the same but when a currency becomes more valuable.


The second reason is because education systems are terrible sometimes and neglectful in one or more areas at other times. Economics is a neglected area in the education system. Kids are taught amazing things in school, but only really learn about a few subjects. Many other subjects are shoved under the rug. Many could argue one of these would be economics.

Many people do understand inflation, and do understand economics. According to the Council for Economic Education, One in three adults will pass a quiz prepared for them by the NCEE. Nine in ten of the adults passed the section on the effects of limiting trade between countries, as well as three fourths of the students passed the same section. While it shows we have a long way to go until most of the nation understands economics fully, it does show that many, many people *do* understand this stuff.

Now, about those recessions. It is the same problem here. You define recession as a depression that was never completed, and you define a depression as a correction period to inflation. We already know that inflation is a term that was biased by you, so now you use it in another definition, which means that this term is now biased as well. This would be manageable if you backed up your definition with evidence, but you do not. The oxford definition of inflation is the following: "a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters". _Of course_ nobody would understand "recessions" if you define them incorrectly!

In conclusion, I like you author, you are consistent man, and a real Libertarian. I just disagree with you. I am sure you are a nice guy, and you truly care about civilization but you fail to properly identify causes, and in your quest have confused yourself.
