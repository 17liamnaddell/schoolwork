1. A market that isn't competitive is the Ice cream market because not all ice cream is the same, and there are not enough ice-cream stores in a theme park to not allow only one to dictate the price. Nor are there enough consumers
2. 
  1. The demand schedule is a table of price points and quantity demanded
  2. A demand curve is the same thing, just graphed out instead of tabular
  1. "A lower price means a higher quantity demanded" -This book
3.
  1. A shift in the demand curve because at any price, people are willing to pay more/less for a given good if their tastes change
  2. A change in price moves along the demand curve because the price increases, and people justly want less. Thus the price and demand changes position.
4. ? Why the decline? not enough info, looks like a typo. Maybe answer is because spinich is an inferior good
5. 
  1. Supply schedule is how much sellers are willing to supply at a given price
  2. Supply curve is a graph version of the supply schedule
  3. Because the suppliers are willing to supply more as the price increases(because they make more money)
6. 
  1. A shift in the supply curve because suppliers are able to supply more of a good at any given price
  2. A change in price leads to more supply as producers are willing to make more goods b/c they make more money
7.
  1. An equilibrium of the market is where there is neither too much of a good, or too little. I.e where the supply and the demand curves cross paths.
  2. The forces that lead to the equilibrium are having too much of a good, and having too little.
    1. Having too much of a good means that sellers are willing to sell the good for less to get rid of the extra
    2. Having too little means that sellers can hike prices without losing busyness.
8. 
  1. people want less pizza at any given price, so there will be less supply
  2. Since beer and pizza are complements, if people don't want beer as much, they also won't want pizza as much
  3. People will expect less for pizza due to the higher prices for beer, so the quantity supplied will go down as pizza is less profitable
  4. People will not have as much money after buying the expensive beer, so they will have less pizza
  5. Price for pizza will go down as people have less money to pay for pizza due to expensive beer
9. Prices dictate more than one thing in markets, in fact they dictate many things. 
  1. The first is how much of a good people want(obviously). If prices are higher, people will want less of a thing, and will either buy less, or not buy it at all! If the prices are higher, but people don't stop buying the good, or not enough stop buying to decrease the sellers profit margin, the seller will make more money, then supply more of the more profitable good
  2. If the price goes down, people will certainly buy more, but the seller will be less enthusiastic about selling the good(assuming they take the loss in price to their bottom line).
