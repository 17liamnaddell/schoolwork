Public goods are goods that no one person or entity owns. Goods can be classified by two metrics. Is it excludable, and is it rival in consumption? Rival in consumption means that one persons use of it reduces the ability of others to use it as well. Excludable means that you can stop one person from using the good. Some examples of public goods are national defense, basic research, TANF and the like.

One problem with goods that are rival in consumption is the tradgedy of the commons where people all try and gather as much of a good as they can, and none of the good is left afterwards.
