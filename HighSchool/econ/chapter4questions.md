There would probably be a housing shortage because more people would be willing to buy due to lower costs, but sellers would make less money so they would want to sell less.

"
There would be less consumer surplus in the market due to the fact that the equilibrium price would be mandated above free-market levels. Since consumers value their surplus, less would want to buy houses, creating a surplus
"

Deadweight loss would be the triangle from (2750,6000) to (1250,6000) to the equilibrium under free market conditions, so if we multiply 2750\*1250\*10,000\*1/2 we would get the amount of lost consumer and producer surplus
