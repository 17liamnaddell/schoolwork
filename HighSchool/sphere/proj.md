    6. Pudding of goose blood
  2. Save the blood of a Goose, and strain it, then put in fine Oatmeal steeped in warm Milk, Nutmeg, Pepper, sweet Herbs, Sugar, Salt, Suet minced fine, Rosewater, Limon Pill, Coriander seeds, then put in some Eggs, and beat all these together very well, then boil them how you do like, either in a buttered Cloth or in Skins, or rost it within the Neck of the Goose.
  3. Presentation: The presentation was awful! They had the gut to serve this meal without the neck of the Goose present, what savages! This meal looked like it was made with InstaPudding of goose blood, and I assure you, it tasted no better. There were barely any feathers of the delecite creature laced around the crock pot it was cooked in.
  4. Taste: There was clearly not enough blood of goose in this recipe, it certainly needed more of that sweet and salty liquid. It was like they milked the goose of it's blood into a collander!
