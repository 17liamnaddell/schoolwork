        <h2>At the wedding</h2>
        People were tense, because of mad Petrucio's constant insanity. Who would blame the poor kathrina to be wedded to such a fether capped turkey baster. He had not showed up to the wedding on time, but when he came, it made people wish he never had shown up in the first place. His outfit accompanied the person with a montra of "she is wedded to me not my clothes" quite nicely. His outfit in tow, he went to the church, and caused such a ruckus that poor Gremio swore a very devil had appeared! After the monotone turkey fethering beta unbalance of a church sermon, rumor spread around that he had punched the holy priest of the ceremony! After this atrocity, he kissed his to be devil's dam with such vigor, that the sound echoed through the halls even after his abrupt departure</p>

        <h2>Ye olde interviews</h2>
        <p>First we interviewed Gremio, who had the following to say about the wedding "It is almost impossible to discribe the disrespect that petrucio has for this holy ground". Then we interviewed Petrucio, but all he could shout back was "I have to leave at the current moment". Kate was just as unfriendly to us megar journalists, as all she could commit to this column were tears.</p>

        <h2>The Aristocritic</h2>
        <p>The presentation of the post-dinner apocalypse was terrible, they had the gut to serve the pudding of goose blood without the neck of the Goose present, what cretains! This meal looked like it was made with InstaPudding of goose blood, and I assure you, it tasted no better. There were barely any feathers of the delecite creature laced around the crock pot it was cooked in.</p>
        <p>Secondly, the taste. There was clearly not enough blood of goose in this recipe, it certainly needed more of that sweet and salty liquid. It was like they milked the goose of it's blood into a collander, what round-necked booty snatchers!</p>

        <h3>The queen murders another man for treason.</h3>
        <p>our take: The murder scene was quite exciting and very entertaining, we would rate this man's death a 4/5 on the GRM-RPR scale. The first two stars were because the noose did not snap the scoundrels neck off, so he died a painful death. And our last two were because the man almost died due to the stones thrown at him from the nine year old kids watching; those rascals!</p>
