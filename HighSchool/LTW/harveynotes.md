Claims harvey is rly tall
The hat with two holes is made for a rabbit
man thinks doctor is wrong
something about a pooka
lwood was once a lovely person
he runs around with a rabbit
the mother is about to faint
it was this because of the fact that she was put in the sanitarium
the pooka protects him for some reason.
threat of lawsuit against sanitarium
the dr finds lwood
lwood claims to have won against reality
the dr is not there yet
lwood is certainly insane
mr wilson is talking to lwood
the dr comes back, with an invisible harvey?
some people claim to have seen harvey
lwood can predict the future
harvey is magic according to lwood
lwood never uses it accordingly
they can't pay a cab driver, because he forgot his purse
lwood is going to be given a injection to make him normal
mother wants lwood to remain like himself for some reason
