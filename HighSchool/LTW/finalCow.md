## Introduction

The classic American literature known as "The Call of the Wild" has many adoring fans, but is this stellar book secretly a proponent of animal cruelty? It will be shown that the innocent-at-first book known as call of the wild is secretly infatuated with animal cruelty for these following reasons. One the abhorrent violence is never cast in a dark light. Two, the dogs grow surrounded in violence as both perpetrator and victim. And finally the law of tooth and club.

## Proof

### First proof

The dogs grow from abuse they create and that is created against them. They learn from an early age that from both master and companion that aggression has its own rewards. Buck used to be a pet for a judge in Canada during the 1890's when unexpectedly he was stolen out of his peaceful word and thrust into the world of being a pack animal. Firstly every pack master used physical violence as the de-facto disciplinary method. This is seen in the man with a red sweater, the last master before Thorton, and all of the ones in between. When buck is transferred away from the judge, he is starved of food and water for two days; after this he is let out of his crate then brutally beaten to be "broken in" like a new pair of hiking boots. These abusive tendencies can also be seen in buck who exhibits many of these abusive traits towards other dogs. Further this can be seen when buck becomes the "pack" leader. He constantly anthropomorphs into a slave-driver when he abuses the other tired and slacking dogs.

### Second proof

The author Jack London is note one to put violence in a dark light. Lets take these quotes as example: "twist it and you'll choke him plenty", "buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity", and "he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for wisdom that outreached his own". He said these things IN RESPONSE TO BEING CHOKED TO NEAR DEATH. And  The club beating from the man in the read sweater is never cast negatively. London never makes this seem wrong. The way you cast negative events is you use tragic words such as mercilessly. London uses a word half as powerful as this once in the entire passage. Buck goes on to learn his "lesson" in the following quotes: "you have learned your place", "he had learned the lesson", "the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect", "A man with a club was a law-giver, a master to obeyed"

### Third proof

And finally, _brutal, grating and exhausting_ law of tooth and club which reins supreme in Bucks pack. Firstly what is the law of tooth and club? It is a more primitive rule system in which might makes right. And secondly what do the doges get or learn from physical supremacy? The dogs instantly gain respect for anybody wielding a club as seen in the above paragraph. This law leads to the "profound" notion that in nature violence is sacred. Violence is unquestionably admirable in the eyes of the book. When Spits, Bucks rival for leader is killed, we rejoice and find glory in violence because of the way the author writes the book. Buck has absolutely no qualms when dismantling spits. I understand he was the instigator but a murder still took place. And to think he was not even punished for this display of sparring prowess by the master. If violence against doges by doges if holy, then violence against doges by humans must be too, and so comes the law of tooth and club. Brutality is morality and ability is defined as the power to hurt.

## Conclusion

Today it has been proven that _The Call of the Wild_ has a bountiful undercurrent of mistreatment under the survival story of buck. My proofs have covered the following topics: Firstly, the violence is never cast in a dark light, Secondly, the dogs grow form violence for and against them, and, finally the law of tooth and club.
