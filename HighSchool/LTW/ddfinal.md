## Introduction

	Write when done with paper (exposition). While FD and BTW were born in vastly different times, they both were slaves at one point, then either ran away or were freed. During FD time, there was a lot of pro-slavery rhetoric created by southerners to make northerners less angry about slavery. Some of these were ideas like "Black people just get drunk if they don't have a slavemaster telling them what to do" and "Black people arn't smart". During BTW's time, there was a desperate need to help former slaves into sucessful lives, while it would be FD's life mission to debunk all of the absurd lost cause rhetoric being thrown around. While both FD and BTW have a lot in common, they do share some key differences as well. some of these key differences and similarities are: Both men have similar backgrounds, BTW was about lifting former slaves out of poverty, and how being born decades apart changed their abolitionist duties .

## Proof

  Both men have similar backgrounds. *Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery, also was a vocal and passionate abolitionist*. In his book, he details how he escaped from slavery as a young man. This might have changed FD's perspective of slavery, because he was still the "property" of his former slaveholder. This contrasts with Booker when he was *mercifully* freed from slavery as a child. *When BTW was freed from slavery he immeditly went out in the world to help other slaves gain freedom from more than slavery.*

  BTW was about helping slaves get into a successful life. First he helped himself out of slavery by attending the Hampton Institute. The next thing he did was teach at Hampton, starting his career in helping former slaves out of the ditch that was poverty. Deciding to move on to bigger thing, Booker T Washington created his own school. *While here, BTW, who used this school to help his students into well-paying jobs, would also raise funding through farming which was aided by his students.* This labour would also serve to teach the students about trades, something that was crucial knowledge in that era. One of the other things he did to help former slaves was to talk through race relations to repair tensions between white southerners and slaves. These examples demonstrate how BTW helped slaves out of the ditch that was slavery by educating them, giving them food, and shelter. In contrast, FD was about abolishing slavery. He accomplished these means by touring the country, while stopping anywhere to spread the news about how atrocious slavery was. One of the myths FD annihilated was the idea that slaves could never attain education. He smashed this rumor by teaching himself how to read and write, as well as wrote his own eloquent speeches that shocked people by their sapience. These examples demonstrate how FD helped in the tearing down of slavery, something that was rendered unnecessary by BTW's time.

  Both men were born in vastly different times. We see this in the fact that FD was born 38 years before BTW. In 1818, FD was born into slavery, conceived by a slave, and an unknown white man. His date of birth, and location would have massive implications on what FD would have identified as a problem for the abolitionist movement. Around this time, lots of false information about the nature of slaves was floating around, and it would be FD's mission to debunk all of it. We cannot say the same for BTW who was way younger than FD, being born in 1856. This, coupled with the fact that slaves were just emancipated, would cement the fact that BTW would need to help slaves just like him into a better life. We see that because of BTW's time period, there were differing needs of the abolitionist movement. In conclusion, even though both men were born decades after each other, they both lived their lives to help the enslaved US population. One to free from slavery, one to free from poverty.

## Conclusion
  While FD was about spreading around how evil slavery was, Booker T Washington helped slaves economically by helping them exit the poverty cycle. My proofs showed that even though both men have similar backgrounds, they both provided different services to the abolitionist world. While neither man was more instrumental in seeing to the end of slavery, they served wildly different purposes. and it is important to all of us to understand their contributions to society of the time, and modern society.
