# Introduction

_The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever._ Mark Twain honors the spirit of boyhood in his awe-inspiring adventure book _Tom Sawyer_.

## Narratio

The setting was at the time of the modernization of even poor towns such as the one this story is set in; boys in the story lead lawless lives outside and live what is supposed to be a sinless life inside. The change is extremely hard for the boys. They must get dressed, washed, and well-mannered to be accepted into institutions such as church, school and home. This was a change that all boys of the time distasted with a passion. The boys of the time would steal, run away, leave home, hate to come inside because they were able to be rowdy outside. They then were forced to get dressed, wear shoes, sit still and not talk. This change brought anger over having to be brought into an environment they were not used to and required more self control and less enjoyment.

## Division


All should agree with the fact that the boys hated going inside and getting "cultured" as Huckleberry Finn would say. Also that most of the boys were rowdy outside then could not contain themselves inside.  But both sides might disagree on why; While in this paper, it will be shown that the boys act the way they do because of how they were treated while growing up, others might say that the kids are just rotten or sinners that need church.

## Distribution

Today it will be proven that the boys in _Tom Sawyer_ act the way they do because of the way they were raised and failed by the three institutions of the time: home, church, and school


# Proof

## Proof 1

Tom and friends were failed by the home they were raised in. This is obvious at the beginning of the book when Tom is lashed because his Aunt thinks he ate out of the sugar bowl. The sad thing about this situation is the perpetrator was not actually him. His Aunt calls him rotten and basically says he is going to Hell if she does not beat him more often. You can clearly see the parenting of the time was horrible. This bad parenting even goes so far as to have one of Tom's friends lashed for having "spilled cream" when it was actually his mother that did it. Even worse is the fact that Huck is the son of the town drunk, and is loved by nobody until the widow Douglass happens upon him twards the end of the book. Society acts like a bondage on the boys who are envied for being free. This was clearly a time where the helicopter mom was a growing trend. The Aunt of Tom does not see that Tom is need of a relationship that does not revolve around punishment. This can be seen by the fact that Tom's Aunt gave him painkillers to stop him from being depressed after happening on a murder scene. The solution was supposed to be maternal comfort and loving support, but instead he got pills. Tom feels so unloved that he actually runs away with other outcasts who have had the similar treatment. Their plan to walk in on their own funerals takes "you don't know what you have until it's gone" to its logical extreme.

## Proof 2

Boys of the time were failed by the Church; you can see this by the fact that the Church could not serve their spiritual needs and turned them off to religion entirely. It was modeled for adults, and was increadibly boring to the kids (and even some adults). They have to get dressed (a thing all of the boys of the time hated), and wear shoes, clean themselves to go to church as well as the punishments of the time were lashings and threats of damnation. Church was used as a wooden spoon, and not a religion. Religion was a shallow exerience with the emphasis on outward appearance and false piety. This can be seen in the fact that the vain girls in the talent/poetry night would carry on and on about how religious they were and end every poem with a lengthy and showy prayer. The winner of the contest was anti-everybody-but-Presbyterian propaganda. Church of the time was no longer about God to these kids, but about preening and self righteousness.

## Proof 3

The boys in _Tom Saywer_ were failed by the *stern schooling system*. This is made clear by the author in that the focus of the book is never on learning, but how cruel the teachers are. The teachers punish the boys with lashings and scare tactics. Mr. Dobbins threatens all of the people in the class when he discovers a torn page in his secret medical book. He goes around the classroom and asks each student if they perpetraited this crime. He glowers into the faces of all of the kids and beats the one that looks most guilty absent of proof. Even though the boys are highly curious, they associate school with lashings and fear of retribution. When they are not getting whipped the boys are being repremanded, and they hate it. There is nothing interesting about the material to them. School was designed for adults and not children of the time.

## Refutation

While this paper shows that Mark Twain believed Tom and his friends were failed by their enviornment, others think that Tom was just a rotten boy like his Aunt constantly complained. But it is obvious that the Church needs to change to fit boys like Tom Sawyer. Tom is going to church but feels like it is a punishment; Tom does not like Church because he cannot express himself. He is rewarded for being deceptive like when he traded general toys and swag of the time to "earn" tickets for his own Bible, but punished when righteous via forced church attendance. He has to get dressed, sit still, pay attention, and avoid play or fun at all costs. The other reason some may not agree with this paper is that Tom does not like school because he is bad. But this is not true. Tom is bad only because he cannot adapt to an environment that is alien to his nature. He basically leads a double life in that when he is bad, he is called Thomas, and when he is good, he is called Tom. He is forced to act one way inside and one way outside. The way he wishes to act aligns with his outside life, but not his inside one.



# Conclusion

In this paper, it was proven that the boys in _Tom Sawyer_ act the way they do because of how their needs were not met at home, church, and school. This may help anybody that wishes to understand how children tick then and now; whether you are a teacher, preacher, or parent this serves as a cautionary tale. and for precocious boys who cannot avoid trouble, this book should be of comfort to you. You are not alone. ðŸ”¥
