# Introduction

## Narratio

The situation was during modernization of even poor towns such as the one this story is set in; boys in the story lead lawless lives outside, and live what is supposed to be a sinless life inside. The change is extremely hard for the boys. They must get dressed and civilized to be accepted into industries such as church. this was a change that all boys of the time distasted with a passion. The boys of the time would steal, run away, leave home, hate to come inside, and were rowdy outside, then were forced to get dressed, wear shoes, sit still and not talk. This change brought anger over having to be brought into an environment they were not used to and required more self control and less enjoyment.

## Division


All will most likely agree with the fact that the boys hated going inside and getting "cultured" as Huckleberry Finn would say. Also that most of the boys were rowdy outside then could not contain themselves inside.  But both sides might disagree on why; While in this paper, it will be shown that the boys act the way they do because of how they were treated while growing up, others might say that the kids are just rotten or sinners that need church.

## Distribution

Today it will be proven that the boys in _Tom Sawyer_ act the way they do because of the way they were raised and failed by the three of the time. The three institutions are: home, church, and school


# Proof

## Proof 1

Tom and friends were failed by the home institution,this is obvious at the beginning of the book when Tom is lashed because his aunt thinks he ate out of the sugar bowl, and the sad thing is the perpetraitor was not actually him. His mother calls him rotten and basically says he is going to hell if she does not beat him more often. You can clearly see the parenting of the time was horrible. This bad parenting even goes so far as to have the one of tom's friends lashed for having "spilled cream" when it was actually his mother that did it. Even worse is the fact that huck is the son of the town drunk, and is loved by nobody besides eventually the widow Douglass. Society acts like a bondage on the boys who are envied for being free. this was clearly a time where the helicopter mom was a growing trend. Tom's mother gave him painkillers to stop him from being depressed about seeing a murder. The solution here was supposed to be comefurt and support, but in response he got painkillers. Tom feels so unloved that he actually runs away with other outcasts who had the same treatment. Their plan to walk in on their own funerals takes "you don't know what you have until it's gone" to its logical extreme.

## Proof 2

Boys of the time were failed by the church; you can see this by the fact that The church could not reach the boys, it was modeled for adults, and was increadibly boring to the kids (and even some adults). They have to get dressed (a thing all of the boys of the time hated), and wear shoes, clean themselves to go to church as well as the punishments of the time were lashings and damnation. Church was used as a wooden spoon, and not a religion. The vain girls in the talent/poetry night would go on and on about how religious they were. The winner was anti-everybody-but-presbeterian propeganda. Church of the time was no longer about god to these kids, but about popularity and betterness.

## Proof 3

The boys in _Tom Saywer_ were failed by school, this is made clear by the author in that the focus of the book is never on learning, but how cruel the teachers are. The teachers punish the boys with lashings and scare tactics. When they are not getting whipped the boys are being talked to, and they hate it. There is nothing interesting about the material to them. School was designed for adults and not children of the time

## Refutation

While this paper shows that Mark Twain wants us to believe that Tom and his friends were failed by his enviornment, others think that tom is just a rotten boy because his mother says so, but it is obvious that church needs to change to fit Tom Sawyer because Tom is going to church, but feels like it is a punishment; tom does not like church because he cannot express himself. He is rewarded for being deceptive, and punished (with church he hates) for being righteous.
The other reason some may not agree with this paper is that Tom does not like school because he is bad. But this is not true because Tom is bad only because he cannot adapt to his environments. He basically leads a double life in that when he is bad, he is called Thomas, and when he is good, he is called Tom. He is forced to act one way inside, and one way outside. The way he wishes to act aligns with his outside life, and not his inside one.



# Conclusion

In this paper, it was proven that the boys in _Tom Sawyer_ act the way they do because of how their needs were not met in home, church, and school. This may help anybody that wishes to understand how children work then and now; whether you are a teacher, general educator or just another child, this paper can and will help you.
