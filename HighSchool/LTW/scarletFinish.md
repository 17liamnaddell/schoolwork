# Introduction

_The Scarlet Letter_ was a groundbreaking book for the time, and challenged the black and white morality of the time. While the morals of the book were amazing, the plot and characters left something to be desired. My review of _The Scarlet Letter_ consists of three parts: First, the morals, Second, The plot, and Third, the bad plot.
 
# Parts

Firstly, the morals. I loved the morals of this book, and if you abstract the well put points of the book, and apply them to modern issues you can see some problems with modern christianity. One of the many problems with the church is that we make some sins worse or better than others. This mentality allows us to put ourselves in the place of God by constantly drawing the "line" behind us. It says in the bible (insert quote) that we all fall short of the glory of God. While at a Hillary Clinton rally have seen a group of "Christians" shouting that pro-choice people go to hell. Not only do they suck at marketing, but they also did nothing but divide people with their poorly thought out morality. The same can be said for gay marriage. "Well as long as you are not gay or a merdurer, you go to heaven."

Secondly, the horrible characters Hesterprine makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Her motives are cloudy at best, and downright nonsensical at worst. The relationship between Dimsdale and Hester is completely forced. The book can best be described as "night fog"; The atmosphere is gloomy, and the characters are foggy.  Their relationship is never explained, and baffles me. Hester and Dimsdale have no reason to do any of the things they do together. One example of their post-scarlet-letter antics is meeting in the woods with a loud kid. Why they do this I do not know. Nothing makes sense, the characters are all irrational and have no clear motives or desire to do any of the things they do. The only thing we know about why Hester had this affair is that Rodger Chillingsworth was bad somehow.

The offensively bad plot. The plot was laid out poorly in that this book has no scenes, no transitions, and no beginning or ending. It makes the book feel long and tedious. The book is highly moralized with extreme characatures of people. Most fairy tales are not heavily character driven, and the characters appear dull and unfacinating, but this is fine because most fairy tales are short and sweet. You can only keep a reader for about 20-40 pages of dullness until they want to put down the book. The plot is character driven, and the characters are bland and not well thought out. The only facit of these characters that is well fleshed out is the pain they feel. In a character driven plot, the number one priority must be the characters, and not the morals. A book should tell a story, have a point, and be compelling. _The Scarlet Letter_ Only hits upon the second neccesity

# Conclusion (must redo)

1. In conclusion, this book was written with the best of intentions, but ended up feeling like a boring and dreary chore. 
2. The morality and message of this book has certainly outlived its flaws, but does not excuse the plot and characters. 
3. idk, isn't a persuasive essay lul
