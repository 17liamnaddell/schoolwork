| They parted ways soon after he wrote the book In Cold Blood during 1966. | That was because of miscrediting | https://www.biography.com/people/harper-lee-9377021 |
| to kill a mockingbird was published in 1960 | kk | http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/newspaper-reviews-thought-kill-mockingbird-became-masterpiece/#.WYYP2PnGBh0.email |
| Fidel Castro came into power one year earlier | This book was written then, so what? | https://www.biography.com/people/harper-lee-9377021 |
| He wrote many many plays, screen performances and things of the sort | Hollywood consipiracy | https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truman_Capote#Friendship_with_Harper_Lee |
| The book became imediatly popular in the western news papers. | Are you incinuating fidel castro paid off the newspapers | http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/fidel-castro |
