# Three points:

1. So was the innocent-at-first call of the wild book infatuated with animal cruelty or not?
2. for these three reasons
  1. the violence is never cast in a dark light
  2. The dogs grow form violence for and against
  3. The law of tooth and club
1. The dogs grow from violence for and against 
  1. Man with red sweater
  2. He becomes the abuser
  3. Violence is the only way doges learn
2. The violence is not put in a dark light
  1. The writing
  2. "twist it and you'll choke him plenty" "buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity" "he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for wisdom that outreached his own" IN RESPONSE TO BEING CHOKED ALMOST TO DEATH
  3. The club beating from the man in the read sweater is never cast negitively. They never make this seem wrong
  4. "you have learned ur place" "he had learned the lesson"
  5. "the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect" "A man with a club was a law-giver" "a master to obeyed"
3. The whole law of tooth and club bs
  1. What is the law of tooth and club
    1. It is a more primitive rule system in which might makes right
  2. What do the characters get from it
    1. They instantly gain respec for anybody wielding a club as seen in the above passage
    2. Why they do not run away, I have no idea
  3. Violance is sacred
    1. Violence is unquestionably good in the eyes of the book, when spits is killd, we rejoice and find glory in violence because of the way the author writes the book
    2. If violence against doges by doges if holy, then violence against doges by humans must be too, and so comes the law of tooth and club
