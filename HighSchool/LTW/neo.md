"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately" -Henry David Thorough. While you may think that this quote is about nature, it is really about you, and about how you should live a fufilling life; Filled with yourself, and nothing else.

The books in question today are Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self-Reliance" and Henry David Thorough's "Walden", named after the pond where he spent two years of his life in solitude.

These books happen in the backdrop of the industrial revolution. These people called "Trancendentalists" thought that we were becoming puppets of the system. They thought to live a satisfying life, you needed to live a "natural existance"

These people published books, met in groups and decided to share ideas and collaborate. Ralph Waldo Emerson trained Thorough on Trancendentalist thought, and eventually Thorough lived out in the wilderness for two years because of the thoughts Emerson shared with Thorough.

While many adore the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thorough, others, such as myself think that they are self-obsessed, sloppy, and perfectly describe the ugly parts of american culture we ignore on a day to day basis.

Today, I will prove to you that Trancendentalism describes the consumerist market forces that drive the economy this day, and every day for these three reasons. First, the rampant anti-educationalism shown throughout the book, Second, the Narcissistic tendancies barely visable behind the nature-loving curtains of the book, and Finally, Neolibralism; Which neatly ties together all of the above elements of the book.


Lets start out with Anti-Educationalism. These men treat education as a harm to society, as if wallowing in your own ignorance is a virtue. This can be clearly seen in the following quotes by Ralph Waldo Emerson: "Believe what is true in your heart is true for all men, now that, is genius", "Man is his own start, and the soul can render an honest and perfect man", and finally: "envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide". As well as one from Henry David Thorough (Who thought europeans were "barbarous and unhealthy" in a time when Americans went to Europe to get cultured): "the old have no valuable experience to give to the young".
