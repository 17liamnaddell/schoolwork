# introduction 
"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately" -Henry David Thorough. While you may think that this quote is about nature, it is really about you, and about how you should live a fufilling life; Filled with yourself, and nothing else.

The books in question today are Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self-Reliance" and Henry David Thorough's "Walden", named after the pond where he spent two years of his life in solitude.

These books happen in the backdrop of the industrial revolution. These people called "Trancendentalists" thought that we were becoming puppets of the system. They thought to live a satisfying life, you needed to live a "natural existance"

These people published books, met in groups and decided to share ideas and collaborate. Ralph Waldo Emerson trained Thorough on Trancendentalist thought, and eventually Thorough lived out in the wilderness for two years because of the thoughts Emerson shared with Thorough.

While many adore the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thorough, others, such as myself think that they are self-obsessed, sloppy, and perfectly describe the ugly parts of american culture we ignore on a day to day basis.

Today, I will prove to you that Trancendentalism describes the consumerist market forces that drive the economy this day, and every day for these three reasons. First, the rampant anti-educationalism shown throughout the book, Second, the Narcissistic tendancies barely visable behind the nature-loving curtains of the book, and Finally, Neolibralism; Which neatly ties together all of the above elements of the book.


Lets start out with
# Anti-Educationalism.

 These men treat education as a harm to society, as if wallowing in your own ignorance is a virtue. This can be clearly seen in the following quotes by Ralph Waldo Emerson: "Believe what is true in your heart is true for all men, now that, is genius", "Man is his own start, and the soul can render an honest and perfect man", and finally: "envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide". As well as one from Henry David Thorough (Who thought europeans were "barbarous and unhealthy" in a time when Americans went to Europe to get cultured): "the old have no valuable experience to give to the young".

Secondly

# Narcisissm. 

According to The New Yorker, On the night of October 6, 1849, immegrants fled to america from ireland to escape the famine. Their ship crashed into some rocks, and around 15 people were killed. Henery David Thorough had this to say about the scene of multiple bloated bodies that had drowned. "On the whole, It was not so impressive a scene as I might have expected. If I had found one body cast upon the beach in some lonely place, it would have affected me more". This is what you can expect from a man that is anti-family, anti-relationship, and was put in jail for tax evasion.

But what about Ralph Waldo Emerson? Same deal; This can be seen in quotes such as "They are not my poor people", and a man that thinks that relief socieies and almost all charaties are bad.

# Neo Liberalism.

You might be wondering, "What is Neo Liberalism? No fear, I will tell you; Neo Liberalism is a economic philosophy that has the following tenants: Consumerism is the most important obligation as a citizen, personal freedoms\>public freedoms, and all social issues are addressed on a private level (source: Henry Giroux, youth in a suspect society)

An example of this would be real standards of beauty Sponsored by Dove. This fits in perfectly with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thorough. The proccess of taking something outside of the system, and making it fit the system's purposes is called cooptation. Trancendentalism has been coopted into Neo Liberalism to create posters, and allow us to pay our way into a lifestyle we do not live ourselves. All of this is fueled by narcissism.

# Refutation

While some believe that works on Trancendentalism are nature loving, self-help books, I believe that Trancendentalism is made to fuel narcissism, and one way is through "appreciating" nature. They believe that works on Trancendentalism are nature loving books because of countless nature quotes such as "We need the tonic of wildness" and, "We can never have enough of nature".
But this is just not what Trancendentalism is about; This is evedent in the mass of the pages on each book being about self-improvement, and not about nature. It is about feeding your narcissism, weather it be validating your self-righteousness through anti-educationalism, or just plain self-centeredness.

The other reason people believe that Trancendentalist material is helpful to american culture is because they appear to be self-help books. Many people believe the above statement because they talk about our culture, and, if we take bits and peices of their advice to heart, then we feel better. Although I would argue that by condemning the rest of society, we only elevate ourselfs, making ourselves the centre of our own worlds.

# Conclusion

I have proven to you that Trancendentalist material is not self-help or nature appretiation material, but is in fact self-centered material that is purposed to boost the ego of the reader. Because of the above reasons, One: Anti ecucationalism, Two: Narcissism, and Three: Neo Liberalism.

Brothers in Christ, I warn you about this because of the virtues of humility the bible provides in <bible Quotes>.
