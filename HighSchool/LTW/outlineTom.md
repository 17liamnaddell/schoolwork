# Introduction 

## Exordium

Develop once paper is finished

## Narratio

1. The situation was during modernization of even poor towns such as the one this story is set in; boys in the story lead lawless lives outside, and live what is supposed to be a sinless life inside. The change is extremely hard for the boys. They must get dressed and civilized to be accepted into industries such as church. A change that all boys of the time distasted with a passion.
2. The boys of the time would steal, run away, leave home, hate to come inside, and were rowdy outside, then were forced to get dressed, wear shoes, sit still and not talk. This change brought anger over having to be brought into an environment they were not used to and required more self control and less enjoyment  

## Division

1. All will most likely agree with the fact that the boys hated going inside and getting "cultured" as Huckleberry Finn would say. Also that most of the boys were rowdy outside then could not contain themselves inside
2. But both sides might disagree on why;
  1. While in this paper, it will be shown that the boys act the way they do because of how they were treated while growing up, 
  2. Others might say that the kids are just rotten or sinners that need church

## Distribution 

1. Today it will be proven that the boys in _Tom Sawyer_ act the way they do because of the way they were raised and failed by the 3 institutions of the time.
  2. The three institutions are 
    1. Home
    2. Church
    3. And school

# Proof

## Proof 1

1. Tom(and bois) were failed by the home institution.
  1. At the beginning of the book Tom is lashed because his aunt thinks he ate out of the sugar bowl. It was not actually him
  2. His mother calls him rotten. And basically says he is going to hell if she does not beat him more often.
  3. One of tom's friends is lashed for having "spilled cream" when it was actually his mother
  4. Huck is the son of the town drunk, and is loved by nobody besides eventually the widow Douglass.
  5. The boys are envied for being free in a time where the helicopter mom was a growing trend.
  6. Tom's mother gave him painkillers to stop him from being depressed about seeing a murder
  7. Tom feels so unloved that he actually runs away with other outcasts, and were envied

## Proof 2

1. Boys of the time were failed by the church.
  1. The church could not reach the boys, it was modeled for adults, and was increadibly boring to the kids (and even some adults)
  2. They have to get dressed, and wear shoes, clean themselves to go to church
  3. The punishments of the time were lashings and damnation. Church was used as a wooden spoon, and not a religion.
  4. The vain girls in the talent/poetry night would go on and on about how churchigous they were. The winner was anti-everybody-but-presbeterian propeganda

## Proof 3

1. The bois were failed by school
  1. The focus of the book is never on learning, but how cruel the teachers are.
  2. The teachers punish the boys with lashings and scare tactics.
  3. When they are not getting whipped, the boys are being talked to, and they hate it. There is nothing interesting about the material to them.

## Refutation

1. As covered in the book, the mother of Tom Sawyer says that tom is a broken child that needs church,
2. But church needs to change to fit Tom Sawyer because Tom is going to church, but feels like it is a punishment; Tom does not like church because he cannot express himself. He is rewarded for being deceptive, and punished for being righteous.
3. Tom does not like school because he is bad
4. Tom is bad because he is sometimes lawless, and sometimes not lawless. It is nearly impossible to lead a double life as an immature boy.


# Conclusion

1. In this paper, it was proven that the boys in _Tom Sawyer_ act the way they do because of how their needs were not met in home, church, and school.
2. May this help anybody that wishes to understand how children work then and now; whether you are a teacher, general educator or just another child, this paper can and will help you.
