# Introduction

1. _The Scarlet Letter_ was a groundbreaking book for the time, and challenged the black and white morality of the time. 
2. While parts of the book were amazing, others not so much.
3. In three parts, I can review the plot of _The Scarlet Letter_. 
  1. The things I liked.
  2. The characters
  3. The plot
 
# Proof

1. I loved the morals of this book, and if you abstract the well put points of the book, and apply them to modern issues you can see some problems with modern christianity. 
  1. One of the many problems with the church is that we make some sins worse or better than others. This mentality allows us to put ourselves in the place of God by constantly drawing the "line" behind us. It says in the bible (insert quote) that we all fall short of the glory of God.
  2. While at Hillary Clinton rallies have seen a group of "Christians" shouting that pro-choice people go to hell. Not only do they suck at marketing, but they also did nothing but divide people with their poorly thought out morality.
  3. The same can be said for gay marriage. "Well as long as you are not gay or a merdurer, you go to heaven."
2. The horrible characters
  1. Hesterprine makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Her motives are cloudy at best, and downright nonsensical at worst.
  2. The relationship between Dimsdale and Hester is completely forced. The book can best be described as "night fog"; The atmosphere is gloomy, and the characters are foggy. 
  3. Their relationship is never explained, and baffles me. Hester and Dimsdale have no reason to do any of the things they do together. One example of their post-scarlet-letter antics is meeting in the woods with a loud kid. Why they do this I do not know. Nothing makes sense, the characters are all stupid and have no clear motives or desire to do any of the things they do
  4. The only thing we know about why Hester had this affair is that rodger chillingsworth or whatever his name was was bad somehow.
3. The offensively bad plot
  1. The book has no scenes with beginnings or endings
  2. written like a fairy tale
  3. ruined by the characters

# Conclusion

1. In conclusion, this book was written with the best of intentions, but ended up feeling like a boring and dreary chore. 
2. The morality and message of this book has certainly outlived its flaws, but does not excuse the plot and characters.
