## day two of buk 

some ppl run away, but not this dude
they repulsed the charge yaiy
union attacks again
they win for now
maybe thesis on war in the middle east
he runs away
his friends ran away
lots of chaos on the battlefield
everybody ran away
he finds a church in the woods, and there was a dead man there
embarressed at not being shot and running away
wounds = red badges of courage
touches wounded man who looks at him, its his friend ithink
youth=henry
his friend runs away
he hurts himself to get a red badge?
calvalry comes back
he hurts his head on something
meets old man in the woods
jack didn't run, and died
he was looking down in shame
maybe he got gamer shotted in the head?
he got grazed?
He goes to sleep
he feels they are all going to die soon
his head feels like "a melon"
they are going to go to war again today
"he had preformed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man.
he feels proud of being in the army
they are back in the fite
they lost, and lots of ppl proly died 
they blame the generals
I tnink they are back in the fight
they are demoralized because they find war pointless
they feel wasted
after being chased, he fights with all his comrades
he is shooting at nothing, they left
he was praised as a hero for holding his ground
they win!
the commander reccomends them for fighting, and likes them.
they are probably going to die in this fight
they walk out drearily(the author sets the tone)
they start firing
the leader dies
they now feel betrayed upon their deathbed
they got flankt
they all die I think
the young soldier holds the flag
the enemy is quite close
the bullets become less and less
they win yaiy
they are mocked by some of the other soldiers for something
the 'mule driver kernel' is ticked at them for not doing something
the 'lad that carried the flag' was praised for bravery
enemy regroups
more fighting
they keep fighting, and are made bitter by the fact they were called mud diggers
the only retaliation he has is his corpse in fight, and he hates the lutenent
rush and hurry
they kill and kill but are getting pushed back
they want to steal the other sides flag
they win again
I think there is peace, and they hate it.
he is praised for murdere 
he knows that he has no red badge unlike his dead friends
he knows he should have died, but retreated
