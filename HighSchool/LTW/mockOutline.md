First point:

1. Connection to cuba
  1. Harper Lee was longtime friends with Truman Capote; They were so close that he is almost suspected of being the true author of the book by some publications.
  2. Truman Capote's 2nd father was a cuban textile broker. Joseph Capote was soon indited of embezzlement.
  3. He would definitely be sympathetic to cuban problems. Harper lee could have connections to cuba through Truman Capote. Truman Capote would definitly be a priority if the cubans wanted to put anti-american messages in films.  
  4. To kill a mockingbird was published one year after fidel castro came to power

Second point:

2. Author's disapearance 
  1. After the publishing of the book Harper Lee gave her last interview in 1964
  2. She was only really seen by the public half a century later
  3. Her next public appearance was in 2007 when she was receiving an award from George W. Bush for destabalizing america
  4. This was only after Raul Castro stepped up to run the country

Third point:

3. Corruption and the spark of the civil rights movement
  1. In the same year as the book was published lindon B Jondson Signed the Civil Rights act
  2. The biggest black character in the book got shot a prison guard at the end of the book. This was clearly inflamatory writing.
  3. The sherrif covers up boo radlies involvement in the attempted murder at the end of the book.
  4. The trial is completely biased, and the characters faith in justice is shaken.
  5. The book became immediatly popular in western newspapers(we all know why) and many southerners were angry. At a book pointing out the racism of the time.

*THIS IS JUST A CONSPIRACY. I DO NOT BELEIVE ANY OF THESE THINGS LOL*.

_Part of this is to make fun of dumb conspiracy theories_
