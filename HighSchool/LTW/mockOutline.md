# Introduction

1. The literary classic _To Kill a Mockingbird_ is wonderfully remembered throughout american literature; but is Harper Lee secretly a cuban implant sent to destabalize america by starting a race war? Probably not but here we go. 
2. Narratio
  1. The book was published in 1960 one year after Fidel Castro came into power. The book was set in the sleepy town of Maycomb Alabama where the main character scout chronicles her growing up in the racism motivated town. 
  2. The people in the book are shaken up when a black man named Tom Robinson is accused of rape by another family. 
3. Division.
  1. While it will be "proven" that to kill a mockingbird was a cuban implant to destabalize america, 
  2. More rational people think that it was just a literary classic that advocated for nessisary social change. 
    1. I will prove today that to kill a mockingbird was secretly conspired by the cubans,
    2. Others will still say that I have not taken my medicine. 
4. Distribution
  1. Now for the following 3 reasons it will be proven that to kill a mockingbird was a cuban conspiracy.
  2.             ^   enumeration   ^
  3. The reasons are the following
    1. The connection to Cuba
    2. The authors dissapearance 
    3. The corurption an dthe spark of the civil rights movement

# Proof 

## First point

1. Connection to cuba
  1. Harper Lee was longtime friends with Truman Capote; They were so close that he is almost suspected of being the true author of the book by some publications.
  2. Truman Capote's 2nd father was a cuban textile broker. Joseph Capote was soon indited of embezzlement.
  3. He would definitely be sympathetic to cuban problems. Harper lee could have connections to cuba through Truman Capote. Truman Capote would definitly be a priority if the cubans wanted to put anti-american messages in films.  
  4. To kill a mockingbird was published one year after fidel castro came to power

## Second point

2. Author's disapearance 
  1. After the publishing of the book Harper Lee gave her last interview in 1964
  2. She was only really seen by the public half a century later
  3. Her next public appearance was in 2007 when she was receiving an award from George W. Bush for destabalizing america
  4. This was only after Raul Castro stepped up to run the country

## Third point

3. Corruption and the spark of the civil rights movement
  1. In the same year as the book was published lindon B Jondson Signed the Civil Rights act
  2. The biggest black character in the book got shot a prison guard at the end of the book. This was clearly inflamatory writing.
  3. The sherrif covers up boo radlies involvement in the attempted murder at the end of the book.
  4. The trial is completely biased, and the characters faith in justice is shaken.
  5. The book became immediatly popular in western newspapers(we all know why) and many southerners were angry. At a book pointing out the racism of the time.
4. I absolutely loved this book and thought it pointed out real social issues of the time. I just wanted to have a little fun with a wierd conspiracy theory.

# Refutation

  1. Even though I have "proved" that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was a Cuban implant, some may still be in disbelief for two reasons. 
  2. This is just a conspiracy
    1. This is a rediculous conspiracy theory that has no real evidence other than coincidence and speculation.
    2. ... Anyways next question. 
  3. This is a terrible way of destabalizing america.
    1. A race war (which this thing could not even cause) would be a terrible way of destabalizing the country because this social issue would not reach government level in enough time.
    2. Fidel Castro was the man that banged his head against walls if he was dared to so he is probably not that smart.


# Conclusion

1. it has now been proven _beyond a resonable doubt_ that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was Cuban implant into american culture for these three reasosn.
  1. The connection to Cuba
  2. The authors dissapearance 
  3. The corurption an dthe spark of the civil rights movement
2. This is important to anybody trying to understand how counter-culture movements are attacked
  1. Marten Luther King Jr. had an approval rating of 33%. Was almost as unpopular as Donald Trump. He was called a communist, and had conspiracy theories like this made about him. People genuninly htouht that the civil rights movement would destroy america.
  2. This paper if one of many arguments that southerners made against counterculture material such as _To Kill a Mockingbird_
*THIS IS JUST A CONSPIRACY. I DO NOT BELEIVE ANY OF THESE THINGS LOL*.

_Part of this is to make fun of dumb conspiracy theories_
