## Introduction

One of the most controversial opinions of the time _Johnny Tremain_ was set in was the idea that the colonies should be separate from the British government. Today I will prove that America should be its own country for these 3 reasons. First, I will go over why America was being taxed. Second, why Britain's taxation of America was unfair, and third, why we needed to go to war to fight off the taxation of America. 

## Proof

## Why Britain was taxing us

Britain's was fighting with France over who should control Ohio. This war was called the 7 years war; it had many countries fighting each other such as Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, and others. Even though Britain won, they became broke, and had to start taxing America to recoup their losses.A ton of Americans didn't like British control, and with the aid of the French, kicked them out of America. had they not done this, we would have been left a piggy bank to *recoup the ravenous ravings of war*.

## Why Britain's taxation of America was unfair

We had nobody fighting for us in parliament, this is seen by the fact that there was only 1 member of parliament against taxing America; if nobody was willing to stop the British from stealing money out of the pockets of the colonists, they will simply continue unabaited. Basically, taxation without representation leads to more taxation. There were so many taxes the British levied against the colonists such as sugar and molasses. They also outlawed Americans from creating their own currency, and forced the colonists to repay the costs of the Boston tea party in pounds, making it even harder to pay off debts. They also passed the stamp tax, which made the Americans have to pay for stamps if they wanted to submit legal documents. The stamp tax made it even harder for the colonists to address legal injustices. This law had only one member in parliament who was in opposition to the tax.

## Why we had to wage war

Britain did not take America seriously and did not think we were capable of successfully rebelling, so they never felt they had to care about our needs and wants. This meant that the British people would not change peacefully. This can be seen in the fact that originally the song "Yankee Doodle" was sung to make fun of the disheveled bramble burner of an American army. It was a mockery similar to the word "redneck" used today. The British government also forced the colonists to house British soldiers. They would eat your food at dinner, sleep in your bed at night, and then attempt to kill you on the battlefield in the morning. This was rightfully infuriating to the colonists.

## Conclusion

I have clearly proven the colonists needed to fight for freedom from an oppressive and indifferent government for the following reasons: Britain felt it necessary to tax us, the British taxation of America was unfair and war was the only path to fix the injustice. This issue was incredibly important to other British-owned countries of the time, such as Australia and India. Our revolution weakened their resolve of the British empire and proved to be a guiding light to other colonies desiring equal independence.
