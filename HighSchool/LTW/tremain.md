## Introduction

1. one of the most controversial opinions of the time _Johnny Tremain_ was set in was the idea that the colonies should be seperate from the british government. 
2. Today I will prove that america should be its own country.
3. For these 2 reasons,
  1. Why Britan's taxation of america was unfair
  2. Why we needed to go to war
4. But first I will go over why america was being taxed
  1. Britan was fighting with france over who should control ohio
  2. This war was called the 7 years war with many countries fighting each other such as austria, prussia, spain, portugal, and others
  3. Even though britan won, they became broke, and had to start taxing america
  4. A lot of americans didn't like british control, and with the aid of the french, kicked them out of murica
  5. America was being used as a piggy bank to recoup the ravenous ravings of war.

## Proof

1. Britan's taxation of america was unfair
  1. We had nobody fighting for us in parlement, this is seen by the fact that there was only 1 person against taxing america in parlement.
  2. If nobody is going to stop the british from stealing the money out of the pockets of the colonists, then they will just steal more money. Basically, taxation without representation leads to more taxation.
  3. There were so many taxes that the british put on the colonists, such as the sugar and mollasses taxes. They also outlawed the americans from creating their own currency, and forced the colonists to repay the costs of the boston tea party in pounds, which made it harder to pay off debts
  4. They also passed the stamp tax, which made the americans have to pay for stamps if they wanted to submit legal documents. This law had only one member in parlement who was in opposition to the tax

2. Why we had to go to war
  1. Britan did not take america seriously, and did not think we were capable of rebeling, so they never felt they had to care about our needs and wants
  2. Origionally the song "yankee doodle" was sung to make fun of the dissheveld american army. It was a mockery similar to the word "redneck" today.
  3. They also forced the colonists to house british soldiers, they would eat at your place, sleep in your beds, and then procede to fight you on the battlefield. This was infuriating to the colonists.

# Conclusion

1. I have clearly proved that the colonists needed freedom from an oppressive government for the following reasons
  1. The british taxation of america was unfair
  2. The fact that we had to go to war
2. This issue was increadably important to other british owned countries of the time, such as australia and india.
  1. Because they too had to rebel from britan, and the ways america went about their revolution could affect the revolutions of tons of british owned countries
