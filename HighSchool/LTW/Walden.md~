1. The thorough society
2. The Theory, Practice & Influence of Thoreau's Civil Disobedience
3. Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced [...] Events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at Walden Pond have been influenced by it, including the national park system, the British labor movement, the creation of India, the civil rights movement, the hippie revolution, the environmental movement, and the wilderness movement. Today, Thoreau's words are quoted with feeling by liberals, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, and conservatives alike.
4. Often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely his misfortune. If you give him money, he will perhaps buy more rags with it
5. I began to pity myself, and I saw that it would be a greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slop-shop on him.
6. Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth.
7. books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations.
8. We need the tonic of wildness...At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature.
9. As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
10. Things do not change; we change.
11. All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be.
12. Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new.
13. A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone
14. for my greatest skill has been to want but little
15. How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book.
16. I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes.
17. There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.
