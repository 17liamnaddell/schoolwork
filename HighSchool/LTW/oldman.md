old man who fishes alone
84 days no fish
40 days without a fish, and the boy with him leaves
he is deeply sunburnt 
there are photographs, his wifu is dead
he is with some boy to teach him to fish
there are yankees, there is baseball
"anybody can be a fisherman in may"
they go fishing a lot
they catch some thingys 
like sardeez nuts
the sun is painful in the morning
sees man of war bird
the bird has something biiiig
there is an escaping fishy
they get poisoned lolololoolo by something
he might see a big one
something gets on his line
he has not cought nything in a 85 days
he caught a marlin
the fish leaves
he feals a giant fish,
