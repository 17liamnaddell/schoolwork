# Proof
1. Anti Education
	1. "Believe what is true in your heart is true for all men, now that, is genius" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	2. "the old have no valuable experience to give to the young" -Henry David Thorough
	3. Thorough thought Europeans were "barbarous and unhealthy" in a time where all of the scholors went to Europe to get cultured
	4. "Man is his own start, and the soul can render an honest and perfect man" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	5. "envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	6. "Believe what is true in your heart is true for all men, now that, is genius" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	7. "envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
2. Narcisissm
	1. According to The New Yorker, On the night of October 6, 1849, immegrants ran to america from ireland to escape the famine. Their ship crashed into some rocks, and around 15 people were killed. Henery David Thorough had this to say "On the whole, It was not so impressive a scene as I might have expected. If I had found one body cast upon the beach in some lonely place, it would have affected me more."
	2. Thorough is anti family,
	3. Thorough was put in jail for not paying the poll tax
	4. Everybody else is desperate, as seen in the very classy quote of: "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation" -Henry David Thorough
	5. Thorough is anti relationship
	6. Emerson thinks that relief societies are bad
	7. "They are not my poor people" -Emerson
3. Neo Libralism (main source: The Philosophy of South Park - Wisecrack Edition)
	1. Neo Liberalism is a economic philosophy that has the following tenants:
	1. Consumerism is the most important obligation as a citizen, personal freedoms\>public freedoms, and all social issues are addressed on a private level (source: Henry Giroux, youth in a suspect society)
	2. Neoliberalism tries to make everything marketable
	3. It will even go so far as to make PC culture a trendy brand you can buy into
	4. Example: Real standards of beauty.... Sponsored by Dove
	5. Neo Liberalism is REALLY REALLY good at bringing what was once outside of the system, and bringing it into the system so that it can serve the needs of the system. I think that Trancendentalism was coopted into Neo Liberalism to make Narcissism and Anti-Education Marketable
	6. Another Example: Whole Foods. Whole foods has ceased to be a place where we buy organic food, and has been coopted to symbolize Healthy Living and Diversity as well as giving to charity. It works like any other product.  Give over some cash, and you get some self-rigteousness in return. 
	7. This kind of political system can even get so dangerous as to make rebellion and opposition ANOTHER commodity
	8. The thing that fuels Neo Liberalism is Narcissism. Something that Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thorough supply in abundance. 
	9. Why Narcissism? It makes us feel good.  
	10. And Finally: Nationalism. It projects your countries greatness onto yourself, making you feel good, and fueling Narcissism. Which only fuels the system. 

# Refutation 


1. While some believe that works on Trancendentalism are nature loving, harmless books
2. I believe that Trancendentalism is made to fuel narcissism, and one way is through "appreciating" nature
	1. They believe this because of countless nature quotes such as "We need the tonic of wildness" and, "We can never have enough of nature".
	2. But this is just not what thorough and Trancendentalism is about. It is about feeding your narcissism, weather it be validating your self-righteousness through anti-educationalism, or just plain self-centeredness.
