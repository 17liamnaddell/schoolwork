# Introduction
1. "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately" -Henry David Thorough. While you may think that this quote is about nature, it is really about you, and about how you should live a fufilling life; Filled with yourself, and nothing else.
2. Narratio
	1. These books happen in the backdrop of the industrial revolution. These people called "Trancendentalists" thought that we were becoming puppets of the system. They thought to live a satisfying life, you needed to live a "natural existance"
	2. These people published books, met in groups and decided to share ideas and collaborate. Ralph Waldo Emerson trained Thorough on Trancendentalist thought, and eventually Thorough lived out in the wilderness for two years because of the thoughts Emerson shared with Thorough.
3. Division
	1. While some people think that works on trancendentalism are nature loving, intellegent books,
	2. I claim that they are self-obsessed, sloppy and responsable for the ugly parts of american culture we ignore on a day to day basis
		1. THESIS: Today, I will show you that trancendentalism is responsable for he uglier parts of american culture, and parts you may not even know about yet.
		2. Even though some think they are wonderful books about loving nature
4. Distribution
	1. THESIS: I will prove that trancendentalism is responsable for the bad parts of american culture 
	2. Enumeration: For these three reasons
	3. Exposition: 
		1. Anti education
		2. Narcisissm
		3. Neo Libralism
# Proof
1. Anti Education
	1. "Believe what is true in your heart is true for all men, now that, is genius" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	2. "the old have no valuable experience to give to the young" -Henry David Thorough
	3. Thorough thought Europeans were "barbarous and unhealthy" in a time where all of the scholors went to Europe to get cultured
	4. "Man is his own start, and the soul can render an honest and perfect man" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	5. "envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	6. "Believe what is true in your heart is true for all men, now that, is genius" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
	7. "envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
2. Narcisissm
	1. According to The New Yorker, On the night of October 6, 1849, immegrants ran to america from ireland to escape the famine. Their ship crashed into some rocks, and around 15 people were killed. Henery David Thorough had this to say "On the whole, It was not so impressive a scene as I might have expected. If I had found one body cast upon the beach in some lonely place, it would have affected me more."
	2. Thorough is anti family,
	3. Thorough was put in jail for not paying the poll tax
	4. Everybody else is desperate, as seen in the very classy quote of: "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation" -Henry David Thorough
	5. Thorough is anti relationship
	6. Emerson thinks that relief societies are bad
	7. "They are not my poor people" -Emerson
3. Neo Libralism (main source: The Philosophy of South Park - Wisecrack Edition)
	1. Neo Liberalism is a economic philosophy that has the following tenants:
	1. Consumerism is the most important obligation as a citizen, personal freedoms\>public freedoms, and all social issues are addressed on a private level (source: Henry Giroux, youth in a suspect society)
	2. Neoliberalism tries to make everything marketable
	3. It will even go so far as to make PC culture a trendy brand you can buy into
	4. Example: Real standards of beauty.... Sponsored by Dove
	5. Neo Liberalism is REALLY REALLY good at bringing what was once outside of the system, and bringing it into the system so that it can serve the needs of the system. I think that Trancendentalism was coopted into Neo Liberalism to make Narcissism and Anti-Education Marketable
	6. Another Example: Whole Foods. Whole foods has ceased to be a place where we buy organic food, and has been coopted to symbolize Healthy Living and Diversity as well as giving to charity. It works like any other product.  Give over some cash, and you get some self-rigteousness in return. 
	7. This kind of political system can even get so dangerous as to make rebellion and opposition ANOTHER commodity
	8. The thing that fuels Neo Liberalism is Narcissism. Something that Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thorough supply in abundance. 
	9. Why Narcissism? It makes us feel good.  
	10. And Finally: Nationalism. It projects your countries greatness onto yourself, making you feel good, and fueling Narcissism. Which only fuels the system. 

# Refutation 


1. While some believe that works on Trancendentalism are nature loving, self-help books, 
2. I believe that Trancendentalism is made to fuel narcissism, and one way is through "appreciating" nature
	1. They believe that works on Trancendentalism are nature loving books because of countless nature quotes such as "We need the tonic of wildness" and, "We can never have enough of nature".
	2. But this is just not what thorough and Trancendentalism is about. It is about feeding your narcissism, weather it be validating your self-righteousness through anti-educationalism, or just plain self-centeredness. 
3. The other reason people believe that Trancendentalist material is helpful to american culture is because they appear to be self-help books.
	1. Many people believe the above statement because they talk about our culture, and, if we take bits and peices of their advice to heart, then we feel better.
	2. Although I would argue that by condemning the rest of society, we only elevate ourselfs, making ourselves the centre of our own worlds. 
4. NEEDS THING HERE:

# Conclusion
	
	1. I have proven to you that Trancendentalist material is not self-help or nature appretiation material, but is in fact self-centered material that is purposed to boost the ego of the reader. 
	2. Because of these three reasons
		1. Anti education
		2. Narcissism
		3. Neo Liberalism
	3. Amplification
		1. This book matters to Christians as well as anybody that does not want to live a self-centered life
		2. Because the bible is strongly against narcissisim.
