	1. According to The New Yorker, On the night of October 6, 1849, immegrants ran to america from ireland to escape the famine. Their ship crashed into some rocks, and around 15 people were killed. Henery David Thorough had this to say "On the whole, It was not so impressive a scene as I might have expected. If I had found one body cast upon the beach in some lonely place, it would have affected me more."
