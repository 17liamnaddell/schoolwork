# Introduction

The literary classic _To Kill a Mockingbird_ is wonderfully remembered throughout American literature; but is Harper Lee secretly a Cuban implant sent to destabalize America by starting a race war? Probably not but here we go. The book was published in 1960 one year after Fidel Castro came into power. The book was set in the sleepy town of Maycomb Alabama where the main character, Scout chronicles her growing up in the race-motivated town. The people in the book are shaken up when a black man named Tom Robinson is accused of rape by a white family. While it will be "proven" that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was a Cuban implant to destabalize America, more rational people think that it was just a literary classic that advocated for nessisary social change. After this paper it will be commonly understood amoung men and wamen that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was secretly conspired by the Cubans, even though others will still say that I have not taken my medicine. Now for the following 3 reasons it will be proven that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was a Cuban conspiracy. The reasons are the following: Harper's connection to Cuba, the author's odd dissapearance, and the corurption coupled with the start of the civil rights movement.

# Proof 

## First Point: Connection to Cuba

Harper Lee was a longtime friend of Truman Capote; They were so close that he is sometimes suspected of being the true author of the book by some publications. This seems like an innocent connection until you realise that Truman Capote's 2nd father was a Cuban textile broker. Joseph Capote was soon indited of embezzlement upon immigrating to America. He would definitely be sympathetic to the Cuban cause. Harper Lee could have connections to Cuba through Truman Capote. Truman Capote would definitely be a priority if the Cubans wanted to put anti-American messages in popular books and films. There is little coincidence that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was published one year after Fidel Castro came to power.

## Second Point: Author's disappearance 

After the publishing of the book, Harper Lee gave her last interview in 1964; she only resurfaced into the public spotlight half a century later. It is odd that such a beloved author disappeared for over 50 years. Her next public appearance was in 2007 when she was receiving an award from George W. Bush for destabilizing America. This was only after Raul Castro stepped up to run the country. I speculate Fidel Castro was upset at her failure to permanently harm American society, and kept her out of the limelight. It was only with the rise of Raul Castro that she could come to the spotlight again.

## Third Point: Corruption and the spark of the civil rights movement

Four years after the book was published, Lyndon üÖ±Ô∏è . Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. This averted social crisis, and was highly unlikely given Lyndon B. Johnson's political history and lineage. This happened even though the obviously inflammatory writing was so clearly bent in favour of invoking outrage . This can be seen in moments like: The biggest black character in the book got shot a prison guard in the end. The sheriff covers up Boo Radley's involvement in the attempted murder at the end of the book. The trial is completely biased, and the characters faith in justice is shaken. The author wants you to lose faith in justice just like the main characters lose faith in justice. The book became immediately popular in western newspapers(we all know why) and many southerners were offended. 

# Refutation

Even though strong evidence has been provided that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was a Cuban implant, some may still be in disbelief for two reasons. This is just a conspiracy. This is a ridiculous conspiracy theory that has no real evidence other than coincidence and speculation. Um... ... Anyways next question. This is a terrible way of destabilizing America. Basically, a race war (which this thing could not even cause) would be a terrible way of destabilizing the country because this social issue would not reach government level in enough time to capitalize on destabilization. Furthermore, Fidel Castro who as a teenager biked headfirst into walls when dared to by his comrades, so he is probably not that smart. This conspiracy theory might be giving him too much credit.


# Conclusion

It has now been proven _beyond a resonable doubt_ that _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was cultural implant injected into American culture during a divisive time. For these three reasons: Firstly, Harper Lee's connection to Cuba. Secondly, the author's unexplained disappearance. And finally, the judicial corruption alongside the start of the civil rights movement. This is important to anybody trying to understand how counter-culture movements, which counter social norms, can be attacked by spurious conspiracy theories. Marten Luther King Jr. had an approval rating of 33%. He was almost as unpopular as Donald Trump. He was called a communist, and had conspiracy theories like this made about him. People genuinely thought that the civil rights movement would destroy America. This paper is one of many arguments that southerners made against counterculture material such as _To Kill a Mockingbird._ In conclusion, as people that consume modern culture, we need to be careful of what we consume; when counterculture movements are made, many attack them in fallacious ways because they are afraid of change, so always watch what you consume.

*THIS IS JUST A CONSPIRACY. I DO NOT BELEIVE ANY OF THESE THINGS LOL*.

_Part of this is to make fun of dumb conspiracy theories_
