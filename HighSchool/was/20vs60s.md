Confederate Statues and monuments in the 1960's and 1920's

## Similarities

The confederate statues were mostly erected in the 1960's and 1920's, as reaction to racial strife of the time. Both were in reaction to civil rights laws at the time. Many of the statues according to the Southern Poverty Law Center were erected in the 20's with a spike in confederate statues in the 60's


## Differences

The ones in the 20's accompanied the rise of the KKK and the Jim Crow Laws. The racial tension was much higher at the time due to the United Daughters of the Confederacy trying to memorialize the dying veterans of the Civil War. The UDC sought to minimize southern wrongdoing in the Civil War as well as with slavery. And they sought to place books in schools that taught the "right" version of the Civil War.
