# Formal summary of the declaration of independence

## Situation

The founding fathers came under criticism for not having real reasons about why they wanted to leave great Britain, so they created this document to explain why they wanted to be free.

## The effect

The effect of this document was to cement the fighting attitude of the founding fathers, they knew what they waned, and now were going to get it. It said to the world, NO, we will not be mistreated by our government any longer, you have mistreated us in these ways, and now we will rebel.
