1. Short Answer Questions 
    1. Define “unalienable rights.” How was this view unique, and how did it impact the U.S.?

      1. Unalienable rights are rights humans physically cannot give up, The examples given in the Declaration of Independence are life, liberty and the persuit of happiness.
      2. This view was unique because many other dictatorships, and monarchies of the time would not attribute rights to people because they wanted to maintain their power. In order for monarcies set up in the late 18th century to retain power, they had to violate what the Declaration of Independence would call unalienable rights.
      3. This view of "unalienable rights" would set the standard of how two humans interact in america on a daily basis due to the fact that when you believe that somebody is entitled to certain things by nature, you refuse to contradict those rights because doing so would invalidate your own unalienable rights. 

    2. What events led up to the American Revolution.  Include important events, laws, people, and dates.

              1. The boston tea party
                1. In December 16th, 1773, the sons of liberty protested the Tea Act of 1773 by throwing 92000 pounds of tea imported from britain into the water. The result was the isle of boston having to pay unreasonable amounts of taxes to the british mainland due to the damage they caused.
              2. The sons of liberty
                1. Founded in 1765, the sons of liberty would be the driving force against british opression from within America. They assembled many protests against british opression while they were active. Although they are not active anymore, they were central figures in starting up the war against britain.
              3. The tea tax
                1. The tea act passed in May 10, 1773 with only one member of parlement against the act would give the British East India Company Tea a monopoly on tea sales in America. Even though it did not create taxes against the colonies(that was done by the 1767 Townshend Revenue Act), it did undercut American tea merchents. 
              4. The boston massacre
                1. On March 5, 1770 british soldiers under attack from a mob shot and killed American citizens, and the newspapers of the time reported many stories calling it the "The Boston Massacre". Even though it was not a real Massacre, that didn't stop newspapers from flooding people's heads with the tragedy. All of this fake news lowered the American colonies tolerance for british behaviour, and was increadably influental.

    3. What documents written prior to the Constitution contributed to it, and how?

        1. Virginia Declaration of Rights
          1. The virgina Declaration of Rights created in May 1776 would shape the constitutional view of unalianable rights. "I That all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. ". This text almost mirrors exactly in the declaration of independence written just a few months later. The declaration of independence feeds directly into what goes into the constitution.
        3. Declaration of independance
          1. The declaration of independence would be why the Americans would leave the british colonies, and the constitution is what would make it so that opression would not happen in America again. The constitution would go on to create laws against, and ban unjust british practices like quartering. 

    4. What problems was the Constitution designed to address?  How successful was it?
      1. It was designed to address the fact that the federal gov't could not support itself monetarily. The government had so little power that it couldn't even collect taxes, and certainly couldn't function for more than a few years. There was barely any upholding of the already weak federal laws, as well as for the fact even the most insignificant minority amoung the states could completely block federal laws from being signed into existance. Thus a "tyranny of the minority" had begun. The majority needed more power. In my opinion, the constitution addressed these problems quite well. It was now easier to get things done, taxes were collected, a LEGIT army could be created. This army was needed to defend america against european colonialism.

    6. Outline the Constitution and its amendments.  Construct a timeline of 10-15 significant events in U.S. history, noting dates, key people, and locations. 

7. Essay Questions

    8. Discuss 3-5 historical figures in American government.  Address their significance to American history.

      1. George washington, He was the first president and an increadibly infuental figure both in winning the war against the british. He could easily have taken more power, but didn't for the sake of the rest of the country, as well as it's future. By the end of his presedency, he was despised amoung his allies, and even through all of this, he still lead the country forward. 
      2. Fredrick Douglass. He was an amazing person, he was forgiving, loving and kind beyond what he should have been. For this reason, he was increadibly infuental, and helped patch racial tensions across all of america. Helping all people in america get along was his lifelong goal. We have to remember that he was a former slave as a CHILD.  
      3. Thomas jefferson. He was the third us president, and he wrote significant portions of the declaration of independance, and thus his work was also part of the constitution. Born on April 13, 1743 he accomplished much in his life, He was elected president as well as vice president, and aided the Luisiana purchase.

    9. Based upon his “Farewell Address,” what do you think George Washington would think of modern-day America? Be sure to base your response on some of his specific exhortations to the nation.

      
      1. "However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion. "
      2. I think George Washington would not like our current America. We have a leader that is unpricipled, destructive of the current way of doing things(which worked for hundreds of years mind you), he subverts the power of the people by trying to collude with hostile foreign governments(two points george washington would have hated). He makes nuke threats and name calls unstable foreign dictators with nukes themselves, as well as most people in america do not want him to be president. 
      3. "Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it. It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another. "
      3. Lets go through this list one by one. He distracts the public councils with his constant rediculousness, agitages the community with false alarms over immigration. 2017 Is one of the most divided years yet, besides petty stuff like the civil war, lets just say there have been a lot of riots, and finally, forign influence and corruption? sounds like it. 
      4. "Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all."
      5. Really sounds like Drumph 


    10. Discuss America’s transition from slavery to freedom.  Include people, events, speeches, court cases, dates, battles, and wars.

      1. There were always abolitionists around america, even in the south, but as presure gathered, and Abe. Lincon became president, it just became too much for pro-slavery states. The succeded from the union, and lincon had to bring them back to keep the states united, as well as to put an end to the moral attrocity known as slavery. After slavery was abolished on Dec. 6, 1865, abe lincoln was assasinated on April 14th, 1865. After the war, the south was destroyed. This was the same time as Fredrick Douglass was going around the south as well as america as a whole talking about slavery. Some of the books fredrick douglass wrote were _Narritive of the life of Fredrick Douglass_(1845) and Life and Times of Frederick Douglass.(1881). In the 1930's confederate veterans were beginning to die off, and the south wanted to "reclaim it's old glory". Thusly the Udc was founded on September 10, 1894, and started creating memorials of the confederacy in the 1930s. As well as they started teaching distorted versions of confederate history to kids. This misinformation would lead

    11. The theme of Challenge I is freedom.  What did you learn in American government about freedom? Discuss what it cost, how it was obtained, how we can protect it.

    12. Freedom is not something that we can give up; in that we physically cannot give it up. To be free isn't to be free from responsibilities, but to be free to express yourself, pursue happiness, and to live. Before we gained independence, we were oppressed by Britain as outlined in the Declaration of Independence. Some of the reasons were taxation without representation, quartering, and the British soldiers killing American citizens. Obtaining freedom was a hard fought battle in which we won with the help of France. It started with slight agressions from Britain, but culminated in the boston tea party, after which rediculous debts were placed on boston, that could never reasonably be paid off. Their port was also closed by the British, and thus war was the only option. The "terrorists" known as the Sons of Liberty rallied the troops, and war was on! Freedom is something that is really hard to protect. The best way in my opinion is by setting high national standards, and having low tolerance for slight transgressions of said high standard. As Americans we should never let anybody, no matter which side they are on cross the line of what is acceptable.
