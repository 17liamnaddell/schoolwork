# Situation

Europe was devastated, the economy was in ruin, and trade had been obliterated. The US was left with much of its economy intact and was placed in a position to help the world. 

# Effects

The money was used to buy necessities like food and gas from the US, and this influx of market activity created more jobs in Europe, and more trade in America. Soon, this money was used for less important goods showing that Europe had recovered successfully.
