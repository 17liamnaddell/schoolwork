Roaring 20's/gilded age

# Who was part of the gilded age? 

Many people, such as the Vanderbuilts and the asters, fishes and many others. These people were also called the nuvo riesh, French for "New Rich". these new rich people spent millions of dollars(in that times money) on vast estates known as "cotteges".

# What life was like in these houses. 

The vanderbilts had over 40 servents at all times around the house, because of this, the people in the houses had almost everything that they need taken care of. While in Rode Island, we saw _The Breakers_, it was an amazing house built by the vanderbilt family. It was huge with rooms plated with platinum. Much of the walls were plated with gold, and the kids of the vanderbilts remember sliding down the massive stairs on silver platters. All of this luxary, was only utalized eight weeks of the year. These "cottages" cost 4.5 MILLION dollars to make. 

# What was the social life like?

Interesting. There were two rich factions at the time, the Knickerbockers and the American/neuvo-rish. The knickerbockers had been rich for hundreds of years. They felt like their great ancestors had made their money in honerous battles of the midevel era, and thusly thought their money had history. On the other hand, the Nevo-rish were considered vulgar because they did not make their money in the way they considered was honerable. They shunned and looked down on the new residents of newport. The nuvo rish wanted to do something about this though. They wanted a better life for their kids and future family; they needed to become part of the high society of newport. 

# The story of how the vanderbilts got in

To understand how they got in, we have to understand who or what was keeping them out.Her name was Mrs. Aster. She hated the vulgar newvo-rish who tried to get their way into high society, and devoted her life to making it as difficult as possible for the new money to ever make it in. Many of her colleges agreed with her, and also grouped up to cast others out. So how did the vanderbilts get in? Firstly they took classes from people on how to obey the complex rules of dinner, how to address people and other foolery of the time. After this, they made great houses that all in the land would want to see. Then they invited people to a dance in the house, they sent ot 2300 invites total, but one name was suspiciously absent from the list. Mrs. Aster. Her daughter begged and whined to her. She wanted desperately to go to this new, exciting and beautiful house alongside her friends, so Mrs. Aster sent out calling card to the vanderbilt house, and her daughter went to the ball.

# Conclusion

The gilded age was a facinating window into the lives of the filthy rich of old. How the nuvo-rish made their money, fortunes and livelihoods would shape the image of america now, and forever.
