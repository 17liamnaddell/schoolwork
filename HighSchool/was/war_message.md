# Situation

As it describes in the article, the Germans were comitting atrocities here, and abroad, so it felt nesissary to Woodrow wilson to make changes. He tried rallying congress together, and succeded in making the inevitability of war apparent to the population of people in congress. As we all know know, not going into this war would have been catastrophic to the general population of the entire world. (Insert merica music here)

# Effects

This speech most likely changed the course of history forever, who knows what the world would have been like if the US had not interviened in ww2.
