The _Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments_ was a revolutionary document in that it was _officially_ adopted as the document that represented the first women's rights group. Even in the way it was structured, it was amazing. It was so because of the resemblance to the _Declaration of Independence_. It gave significantly more credibility to the statement simply because it was what the founding fathers used as justification for leaving the British monarchy. It clearly spelled out that women in the time were oppressed and had no real rights. Documents and foundations like this contribute to the progress and steps forward that the society of the time desperately needed.
