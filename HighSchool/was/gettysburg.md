# Situation

The battle of Gettysburg was brutal and hard fought. Even for the winning side, the losses must have been staggering. This was a victory, but a demoralizing one, because of all the losses. 

# Effects

Abe Lincoln's speech rallied all of the people who had lost friends and fellow troops together. It was sorely needed. Without this, it would have made the war harder to fight for the Union.
