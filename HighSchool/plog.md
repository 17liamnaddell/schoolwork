## Tuesday, May 23rd:
today, I wrote a minilexer for parsing a extended markdown file. It would have the question followed by a semi-colon, and on a newline, would be the answer. The program was 60 lines, and pretty complex. I wrote it in an hour.

Today is more of a dump log.

I got gentoo linux to install after multiple hours and 10 failed attempts.
I got minecraft working on 10 year old ebay computers for ALC. This is miraculous. 
The minecraft camp I am putting (with Angela Peterson) on can run now. yay

## Thursday, Jun 15

I spent 3 hours last night (staying up until two) installing gentoo linux in case arch linux does not pan out
I also came to the building at 10:00 to work on the computers. 
I worked for an hour.

## Monday, Jun 19

I installed gentoo onto a tower, and installed arch linux onto that tower. I got FORGE modloader and optifine working together. I installed a few mods, and wrote the curriculum for the camp(an abstract version)

## Tuesday, Jun 20

I wrote a program that swaps out the worlds for minecraft automatically
did about 4 hours today

## Monday, July 3

I installed gentoo linux on two operating systems(multiple days ago), and installed LFS on archie.
LFS is the hardest linux distribution that is still maintained to install.
also today, I installed two programs(a very hard task on lfs). They allow me to enteract with windows computers, and some linux computers

## Tuesday, July 11

I have recompiled the linux kernel more than 10 times already. and have 3 releases of the kernel. I got networking working on lfs, which is a feat. I also started a networking project in golang, and it worked. It took a few minutes, but is a good proof of concept

## Wednsday, July 19

Stayed up till 2:00 in the morning researching SDL
My project is to make a web crawler in sdl
it is hard

## Thursday, July 20

Recompiled the linux kernel 3 times, helped out some people in skilstak, and they helped out me, I also got sound working via headest.
this is kewl

## Monday, July 24

I recompiled the kernel a lot, and got auxillary/jack speakers working with pulseaudio. Linux sound is overcomplicated at best, and was very difficult. I also got NFS working which is awesome. The answer to my month long problem was quite simple. A long time ago(a few days) I got mr robs graphical
web crawler working
