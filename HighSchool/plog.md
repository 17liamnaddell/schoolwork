I worked on go-lmdlx for about an hour. I automated lexing text with a left and a right delimeter. 
## Tuesday, May 23rd:
today, I wrote a minilexer for parsing a extended markdown file. It would have the question followed by a semi-colon, and on a newline, would be the answer. The program was 60 lines, and pretty complex. I wrote it in an hour.
