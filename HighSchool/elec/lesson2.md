Electronic Circuit: An assemblage of interconnected electronic components 
ELECTRONIC DIAGRAMS:
a series of big and short lines that are parallel=battery +=up -=down
wavy lines=resistor
ground=down arrow
capacitor=two parallel lines
diode=up arrow into line
transformer=two coils on the sides
switches=switches
parallel circuit= two circuits that are parallel
straight circuits= a straight line of circuits that have no other way of transporting electrons
