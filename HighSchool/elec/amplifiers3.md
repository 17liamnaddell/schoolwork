## The search for the ideal amplifier

Many things besides audio are amplified every day bro
Pressure sensors are one of these.
Pyranometer is another
We want high gain.
Or a easily controlled gain
Ideal gain=Infinate.
Tempered with negative feedback
We want low output resistance
Ideal: Zero
More power to ya! (lol)
We want high input resistance to draw minimal current
Ideal: Infinate
Ideal amplfier would not look like it was connected to anything.
We also want a flat frequency response
We need it to amplify DC and AC which means we cannot use capacitors

## Difference amplifier

Has an npn transistor
Resistor in the emitter lead
Then mirror this circuit along the line of symmetry
Gives zero output if there is no difference in circuits
output voltage = v1-v2
Next few lessons are going to be about opamps
Compact difference amplfier
2 inputs
1 output
High Gain
Low output resistance
High input resistance
Broad frequency response
Can handle 
DC
741 Op amp created in the 70's
TL081 Op amp is the default for circuitlab
Nas a Noninverting input, and a inverting one
Has a positive power supply
And a negative power supply
And one output
Vout=A(V+-V-)
