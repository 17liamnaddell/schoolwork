  2. getting distance with infared sensors using arduino
  3. Blinking leds controlled by a raspberry pi with both transistors and no transistor

The goal of the Electronics class is to complete The Great Courses Plus course on Electronics. This course covers things like Analog and Digital Electronics, MOSFET Transistors, AC and DC electronics, Integrated Circuits, and much more. This course on electronics was taught by Richard Wolfson, Ph.D.  So far I have gotten to lesson 18 out of 24, and completed multiple projects related to electronics. One of these projects has been to work with resin.io to deploy code to Raspberry Pi's using Docker. One of these would switch pins on the GPIO to HIGH at a one second interval using golang and the gobots.io package; I also created this same program in Python3. Another project I did was running an infrared sensor off of an Arduino in order to calculate disance of objects from the camera.
