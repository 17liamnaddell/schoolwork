# Electronic feedback

1. This allows us to tame opamp gain
  1. This allows us to tame the opamp gain because the more current will balance out the zero positive input dedicated to this circuit. 
1. Electronic feedback is feedback without moving parts such as motors
  1. This is more accurate because it does not rely on the delay of motorized parts
1. To find the gain of a opamp with negative feedback in the negative terminal, we need to find vout/vin
1. Warning: math and graphical explanations alert: I cannot really explain what is going on here lol
1. After a lot of math we get that vout=-(Rf/Rin)Vin

# OpAmp rules

1. No current flows into the opamp inputs
2. W/ negative feedback, v+=v-
3. B/c the negative feedback will deminish the current, the current will be multiplied by the opamp, and then it will be replenished, the cycle repeats.

this whole process allows us to tame the gain of the opamps(which is huge). Now we can amplify any current to almost any degree as we chose
