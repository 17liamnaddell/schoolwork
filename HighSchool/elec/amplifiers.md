* +10v = connected to a 10 v power supply
* amplifiers are usually used with millivolts
* transistors can be amplifiers
* audio amplifiers turn electric signals into sound
* anything that produces sound has an audio amplifier
* Two power sources neccisary, one for the transistor, one for the electric signals that will be converted to sound waves
* first circuit does not work because transistors require a certain current to work becuase they are diodes
* I need to learn how to bias a transistor
* you need some kind of base current (1/2 of 10v) to activate the transistor
* the gain of this transistor would be 1.5 or 150v, 150v\*greater
* this is an inverting amplfier, which means that data that comes in is inverted.
* Ohms law, and load line analysis determines how voltage goes across resistors
* 10v - 1kohm = 10miliamps
* a biased transistor has a operating point in the middle of the vi-chart
* cutoff = no current
* saturation=most possible current, set by value of power supply
* when you increase voltage, the input flattens at the top, you have reached the cutoff
* with better biasing, the amplifier can handle more current
