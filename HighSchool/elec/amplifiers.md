+10v = connected to a 10 v power supply
usually used with millivolts
transistors can be amplifiers
audio amplifiers
anything that produces sound has an audio amplifier
Two power sources neccisary
first circuit does not work because transistors require a certain current to work becuase they are diodes
need to learn how to bias a transistor
you need some kind of base current (1/2 of 10v) to activate the transistor
gain would be 1.5 or 150v, 150v\*greater
this is an inverting amplfier
Ohms law, and load line analysis determines how voltage goes across resistors
10v - 1kohm = 10miliamps
a biased transistor has a operating point in the middle of the vi-chart
cutoff = no current
saturation=most possible current, set by value of power supply
when you increase voltage, the input flattens at the top, you have reached the cutoff
with better biasing, the amplifier can handle more
