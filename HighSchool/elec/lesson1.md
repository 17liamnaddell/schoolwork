Ohm's Law

I=V/R; V=IR; R=V/I
current * voltage= power/watts

Projects: Hard Starting, LED Lamps

1. The connection between a car's battery and the wire supplying the starter motor has corroded to the point where its resistance is 0.05Q. When you try to start the car, the starter motor draws 100A. What's the voltage across the bad connection
  1. 5V


2. An LED lamp operates at 120V and puts out the same amount of light as a standard 100W incandescent lamp. It draws 150 mA of current. Compare the power consumption of the two lamps
  1. the LED lamp draws 82 less watts than the incandescent lamp
