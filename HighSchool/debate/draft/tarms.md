How Common Is PTSD?

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur after you have been through a trauma. A trauma is a shocking and dangerous event that you see or that happens to you. During this type of event, you think that your life or others' lives are in danger.

Going through trauma is not rare. About 6 of every 10 men (or 60%) and 5 of every 10 women (or 50%) experience at least one trauma in their lives. Women are more likely to experience sexual assault and child sexual abuse. Men are more likely to experience accidents, physical assault, combat, disaster, or to witness death or injury.

PTSD can happen to anyone. It is not a sign of weakness. A number of factors can increase the chance that someone will develop PTSD, many of which are not under that person's control. For example, if you were directly exposed to the trauma or injured, you are more likely to develop PTSD.

Here are some facts (based on the U.S. population):

    About 7 or 8 out of every 100 people (or 7-8% of the population) will have PTSD at some point in their lives.
    About 8 million adults have PTSD during a given year. This is only a small portion of those who have gone through a trauma.
    About 10 of every 100 women (or 10%) develop PTSD sometime in their lives compared with about 4 of every 100 men (or 4%). Learn more about women, trauma and PTSD.

PTSD and the Military

When you are in the military, you may see combat. You may have been on missions that exposed you to horrible and life-threatening experiences. These types of events can lead to PTSD.

The number of Veterans with PTSD varies by service era:

    Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF): About 11-20 out of every 100 Veterans (or between 11-20%) who served in OIF or OEF have PTSD in a given year.
    Gulf War (Desert Storm): About 12 out of every 100 Gulf War Veterans (or 12%) have PTSD in a given year.
    Vietnam War: About 15 out of every 100 Vietnam Veterans (or 15%) were currently diagnosed with PTSD at the time of the most recent study in the late 1980s, the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS). It is estimated that about 30 out of every 100 (or 30%) of Vietnam Veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime.

Other factors in a combat situation can add more stress to an already stressful situation. This may contribute to PTSD and other mental health problems. These factors include what you do in the war, the politics around the war, where the war is fought, and the type of enemy you face.

Another cause of PTSD in the military can be military sexual trauma (MST). This is any sexual harassment or sexual assault that occurs while you are in the military. MST can happen to both men and women and can occur during peacetime, training, or war.

Among Veterans who use VA health care, about:

    23 out of 100 women (or 23%) reported sexual assault when in the military.
    55 out of 100 women (or 55%) and 38 out of 100 men (or 38%) have experienced sexual harassment when in the military.

There are many more male Veterans than there are female Veterans. So, even though military sexual trauma is more common in women Veterans, over half of all Veterans with military sexual trauma are men.

Symptoms of PTSD

Available in Spanish: SÃ­ntomas del TEPT | Ver todos

It is normal to have stress reactions after a traumatic event. Your emotions and behavior can change in ways that are upsetting to you. Even though most people have stress reactions following a trauma, they get better in time. But, you should seek help if symptoms:

    Last longer than three months
    Cause you great distress
    Disrupt your work or home life

What are the symptoms of PTSD?

Symptoms of PTSD may disrupt your life and make it hard to continue with your daily activities. You may find it hard just to get through the day.

There are four types of PTSD symptoms:

    Reliving the event (also called re-experiencing symptoms)

    Memories of the traumatic event can come back at any time. You may feel the same fear and horror you did when the event took place. For example:
        You may have nightmares.
        You may feel like you are going through the event again. This is called a flashback.
        You may see, hear, or smell something that causes you to relive the event. This is called a trigger. News reports, seeing an accident, or hearing a car backfire are examples of triggers.
    Avoiding situations that remind you of the event

    You may try to avoid situations or people that trigger memories of the traumatic event. You may even avoid talking or thinking about the event. For example:
        You may avoid crowds, because they feel dangerous.
        You may avoid driving if you were in a car accident or if your military convoy was bombed.
        If you were in an earthquake, you may avoid watching movies about earthquakes.
        You may keep very busy or avoid seeking help because it keeps you from having to think or talk about the event.
    Negative changes in beliefs and feelings

    The way you think about yourself and others changes because of the trauma. This symptom has many aspects, including the following:
        You may not have positive or loving feelings toward other people and may stay away from relationships.
        You may forget about parts of the traumatic event or not be able to talk about them.
        You may think the world is completely dangerous, and no one can be trusted.
    Feeling keyed up (also called hyperarousal)

    You may be jittery, or always alert and on the lookout for danger. You might suddenly become angry or irritable. This is known as hyperarousal. For example:
        You may have a hard time sleeping.
        You may have trouble concentrating.
        You may be startled by a loud noise or surprise.
        You might want to have your back to a wall in a restaurant or waiting room.
