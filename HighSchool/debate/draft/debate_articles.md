In the wake of another Memorial Day, when most Americans recognized their fallen veterans by staying home from the office, it’s worth taking a moment to consider a perennial question: Should the military draft return? Yes, argued Joseph Epstein in The Atlantic earlier this year. Epstein, a short
story writer and former draftee who served in the Army from 1958 to 1960, opposes an all-volunteer force for several reasons: It’s unfair for a tiny percentage of Americans—less than one percent—to shoulder the burden of fighting wars; the American public isn’t knowledgable enough on foreign policy;
the draft could rehabilitate young criminal offenders; and, most of all, a draft would contribute to the “melting pot” that makes America great.

Melvin R. Laird was secretary of defense from 1969 to 1973 and counselor to the president for domestic affairs in 1973 and 1974. He represented Wisconsin in the U.S. House from 1953 to 1969.

Just over 40 years since the United States implemented the all-volunteer military force, some are once again suggesting that a draft force could be better. I managed development of the all-volunteer concept that President Richard Nixon endorsed, and I believe that returning to the draft would be
a mistake. No president has advocated a return to conscription, Congress does not support it, and the American people would not stand for it — all with good reason.

The all-volunteer force has surpassed expectations. After more than a decade of sustaining combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while meeting other global obligations, our force has been successful by virtually every measure. The “total-force” concept, which I conceived, more closely links
active-duty, National Guard and reserve military components. The volunteer military is more intelligent, fit, committed and representative than ever. Moreover, it has proved more cost-effective than a draft force.

Each year about 160,000 young men and women volunteer for active duty. An additional 110,000 volunteer for the reserves and the National Guard. Twenty-five thousand others are commissioned as officers, according to Defense Department data. Last year marked the 27th consecutive year in which the
Pentagon has exceeded its quality standards for active-duty recruits. Half of all recruits are in the top two of the Armed Forces Qualification Test’s five categories, Defense Department personnel data show, with only 1 percent in the lowest. In the last year of the draft, only one-third of recruits
were in the top two categories, with 25 percent in the lowest. Whereas only three-quarters of youths nationwide graduate from high school, all military recruits are required to have graduated. (During the last year of the draft, only half of recruits were high school graduates.)

Veterans Day was cold and rainy in my hometown this year. But it wasn't just the weather that dampened parades. It was also the nagging thought that though the holiday honors those who fought in past wars, the ongoing conflict in US-occupied Iraq is currently turning out the largest new wave of
combat veterans since Vietnam. 

Equally sobering were two articles I read on November 11, a date originally set to commemorate the end of armed hostilities. One carried the headline, "Talk of a Draft Grows Despite Denials by White House." The other reported on the 7,500 U.S. soldiers that have been wounded in action since
April--and are now flooding military hospitals like Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. 

As a counselor I have talked with veterans of every major war in the last century. I have looked into their haunted eyes and listened to their stories. Personally, I am adamantly opposed to armed force and belong to a peace church that has a 450-year history of speaking out against all violence. 

Still, I have wondered whether it wouldn't be a blessing for today's youth to be faced with a military draft--provided that they have the alternative of choosing to become a conscientious objector. 

My generation (I became a teen during the McCarthy era) came of age when opposition to war cost something. My peers and I had to decide to either join the military or volunteer for alternative service as conscientious objectors. And no matter what we chose, we all saw combat, in a sense: not one of
us could evade the battle that takes place inside when one is faced with such a question. 

At that time most Americans had no trouble accepting a military draft: they understood the fight against communism as a conflict between good and evil. A recent immigrant and the child of refugees from Nazi Germany, I cherished my adoptive country's freedoms. But having been brought up to follow the
teachings of Jesus, I was also convinced that killing people can never be right. 

I knew that most Americans did not look kindly on such a view. Though many understood how one's faith might prevent one from signing up, many more saw conscientious objectors as draft dodgers and cowards, and hated them for it. As a young man, I knew what my faith demanded, and I knew that I had to
honor its demands. Looking back I feel being forced to make this decision made me stronger. 

That's why I believe it could be healthy for today's youth to face a similar choice. Deciding which side to stand on is one of life's most vital skills. It forces you to test your own convictions, to assess your personal integrity and your character as an individual. 

Each of us knows right from wrong, but we often lack the courage to act on that knowledge. How many of us are secretly troubled--if not outraged--by the atrocities that are being committed in the name of the "war on terror"? How many of us feel isolated and insecure, but are too afraid to speak out? 

If the White House and Congress decide to reinstate mandatory military service, it will sober our minds and especially the minds of young people. For too long we have not appreciated the freedoms and standard of living our country offers us, in contrast to the stark poverty that faces at least two
thirds of the world. I hope that the hard times that may lie ahead of us all will help us realize that no one can live without a close relationship to God and to his neighbor. There is a power much greater than the mightiest military arsenal. That is the power of love and forgiveness, which in the
end will lead people and nations together instead of apart. It is the only power that will bring healing and peace, especially to those who have been wounded and maimed as a result of war, and to those families who have lost loved ones--men and women who were willing to pay the ultimate price. 

A draft would present every young person with a choice between two paths, both of which require courage: either to heed the call of military duty and be rushed off to war, or to say, "No, I will give my life in the service of peace." Let God decide which choice is more patriotic.
