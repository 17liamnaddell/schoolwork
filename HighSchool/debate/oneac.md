## Harms

1. Our infrastructure is failing:
  1. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave our infrastructure a D+ grade.
  2. "In addition to assigning grades to America's ports and parks, the 2017 report card projected a total investment of $4.59 trillion that would be required to bring U.S. infrastructure from where it stands today — at a D+ — to a B grade."

2. The US military and government is hated nationally and abroad
  1. The confidence in police officers and the police force is at it's lowest in 22 years.

## Plan

1. The United states will start a national draft, but instead of putting the new soldiers into combat, we will work on infrastructure projects locally and abroad. 

### Mandates

1. Congress will pass legislation starting a draft that.
2. Congress will also pass legislation proposing that all members of the upcoming draft will be deployed to civil or foreign infrastructure support jobs
3. Congress will half the budget of the US military to force the stopping of unnecessary wars.
4. The draft will end in 10 years, and will have each drafted member be serving for one year

### Agency

The Army National Guard will enact this order to draft and recruit men and woman to serve internationally and locally.

### Funding

1. "Every dollar spent enforcing US tax laws yields 6 dollars in collections." -Treasury secretary Jacob J. Lew
2. If we increase the IRS budget to 70 billion dollars for ten years, as well as cutting the military budget in half, we will get enough money to rebuild all of America's infrastructure.

### Enforcement


The current policy will be kept for people avoiding the draft.

## Advantages

1. Over a few years, all of America's infrastructure will be rebuilt to a higher quality. This will keep the country safe from dangerous infrastructure.
2. Rebuilding or building new infrastructure will create more trust in the government locally, and abroad. Locally, people who feel like their taxes are getting them no where will be delighted to find new roads, better bridges, a better quality of service from the IRS and a more giving community.  Abroad, people in the middle east and other war-torn countries who have always seen the United States military as a killing force, should now see the military as a group of people who can do good for the country. This will win the hearts and minds of the people there, and will allow the US government to keep stability for the nation at home because these countries we help will be more willing to share information about terrorists with us. This will allow us to more successfully weed out the people who wish to do us harm from entering the country
3. it will increase trust in the IRS, so people will be less likely to try and get away with tax evasion. This will help the national debt, and make the tax system feel more fair.
4. People will be able to learn STEM related things and will be more interested in engineering. This will allow us to have a more competitive workforce and increase wealth and productivity.
